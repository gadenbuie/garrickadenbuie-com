Hello, my name is Garrick Aden-Buie.

I'm a **Data Science Educator** and R developer at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com).
I use R, R Markdown, Shiny, and the tools of data science to make it easier to teach and learn data science with R.
Prior to working at RStudio, I was a data scientist at the [Moffitt Cancer Center][moffitt] where I work in the [Collaborative Data Services Core][moffitt-cdsc]. 
Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of South Florida][usf] in Tampa, FL in the [Department of Industrial and Management Sciences Engineering][usf-imse] where I helped develop a [smart home sensor technology system to enable healthy aging in-place](https://usfweb.usf.edu/usf-news-archive/News/article/7974).

I'm a passionate R user and educator.
I build [web apps][garrick-apps] using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [tools and packages][garrick-projects] for [R](https://r-project.org), and dynamic, interactive, reproducible reports using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
Browse my [list of projects][garrick-projects] for examples of my work, a [selection of educational presentations][garrick-talks], or review my [full curriculum vitae (resume)](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/resume/).

### Let's do something awesome together!

### A little bit more about me... 

As an undergrad, I studied at [Lehigh University](https://lehigh.edu/),
in [Bethlehem, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allentown_(song)), only
twenty minutes from where I grew up. There, I received a B.S in Applied
Mathematics. I also spent a year living and studying in Madrid, Spain,
which helped me earn a B.A. in Spanish at Lehigh.  

I am a [Returned Peace Corps Volunteer](https://peacecorps.gov/).
I lived in small town outside of Cuenca, Ecuador where I taught Math, English and life and parenting skills.

I also [write songs and play acoustic guitar](https://garrickadebuie.bandcamp.com/), sometimes [in public](http://www.songkick.com/artists/6913204-garrick-adenbuie) (though not as much as I would like to).
