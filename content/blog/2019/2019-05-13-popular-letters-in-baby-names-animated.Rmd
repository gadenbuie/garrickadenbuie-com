Earlier this week, a tweet from Kieran Healy caught my attention with a neat [animation of the popularity of the final letters](https://twitter.com/kjhealy/status/1127951257392623616) of baby names.

```{r}
blogdown::shortcode("twitter", "1127951257392623616")
```

I'm also a big fan of [[gganimate]]{.pkg} - check out my first project with [gganimate]{.pkg}, a collection of [join animations called _tidyexplain_][tidyexplain].
And the [[babynames]]{.pkg} package by [Hadley Wickham][hadley] makes it pleasantly easy to work with the baby names data reported by the U.S. Social Security Administration.

Kieran's animations inspired several questions that I hope to answer (or at least visualize) in this post:

1. What about _any_ letter within a baby's name? I understand why first and last letters would be interesting, but how has the popularity of any letter used in a baby's name changed over time?

1. Can we visualize both _male_ and _female_ names in the same animation without overloading the animation?

1. While I love [gganimate]{.pkg} and animated plots, are static plots more effective at displaying the same information?

Rather than answer these questions definitively or scientifically, I've stuck with the fun parts and made a few visualizations.
I'll let you decide how effective they are.
(And feel free to let me know on Twitter at [&commat;grrrck][grrrck].)

## Getting Started

To get started, I load the following packages, all installed from CRAN with `install.packages()`.

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(babynames)
```

Next, I set up a base [ggplot2]{.pkg} theme that I'll use throughout.
Note that you can also set the `ggplot2` theme globally with `theme_set()`, but I'm not here for complicated reasons related to my use of [knitr caching](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/cache/) to speed up intermediate rendering.

I also used the [[showtext]]{.pkg} and [[sysfonts]]{.pkg} packages.
These two sister packages are my go-to packages for reliably being able to use [Google Fonts][google-fonts] with [ggplot2]{.pkg} on any system.

```{r theme, echo=TRUE}
showtext::showtext_auto()
sysfonts::font_add_google("PT Sans")
sysfonts::font_add_google("PT Sans Narrow")
base_theme <- 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16, base_family = "PT Sans") +
  theme(
    legend.position      = c(0.5, 0.9),
    legend.text          = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),
    legend.background    = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
    legend.direction     = "horizontal",
    legend.justification = "center",
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text     = element_text(family = "PT Sans Narrow"),
    axis.text.x   = element_text(vjust = 0.9, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y  = element_text(margin = margin(r = 5)),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5, margin = margin(t = 10)
    ),
    plot.caption  = element_text(color = "grey40", lineheight = 1.1)
  ) 

sex_colors <- c("Male" = "#00589A", "Female" = "#EB1455")
caption_text <- paste(
  "Source: babynames, U.S. Social Security Administration",
  "@grrrck", "garrickadenbuie.com",
  sep = " | "
)
```

## How Popular are Letters Used Anywhere in Baby Names

### Letters in Baby Names

To answer the first question, I need to first establish what letters are used in a name, regardless of the letter's position in the name, and not counting duplicates.
Rather than repeatedly calculate this information for every year, sex, and name pair in `babynames`, I used `distinct()` from [dplyr]{.pkg} to obtain the list of unique names.

```{r babynames-and-letters, echo = TRUE}
babynames_and_letters <- 
  babynames %>% 
  distinct(name) %>% 
  mutate(letter = strsplit(tolower(name), character())) %>% 
  # strsplit() returns a list for each name,
  # so 'letter' is a list-column that can be converted to a
  # normal column with unnest()
  unnest(letter) %>% 
  # count each letter once
  distinct()

babynames_and_letters %>% 
  filter(name == "Garrick")
```

Then I joined `babynames` with the `babynames_and_letters` table to get the sum of the proportions of the population (by year and sex) that have each letter in their name.

```{r babynames-containing, echo = TRUE}
babynames_containing <-
  left_join(babynames, babynames_and_letters, by = "name") %>% 
  group_by(letter, year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(year >= 1900) %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = "Male", F = "Female")) 

babynames_containing %>% 
  filter(letter == "g") %>% 
  head()
```

### Plot and Animate

At this point, my typical [gganimate]{.pkg} workflow is to first create a static [ggplot2]{.pkg} plot as a sanity check for the animation.
If the static plot works with `facet_wrap(~ state_column)`, then using `transition_state(state_column)` is likely to work well (although you may need to filter the data to preview only a few states).
In this case, I'm using `year` as the state column.

I generally try to structure my [ggplot2]{.pkg} code in a consistent way (future blog post?) so I prefer having the [gganimate]{.pkg} specific parts at the end.
I also directly called `gganimate::animate()` so that I could control specific parameters of the output, namely the number of frames and the size of the image.
The default number of frames is 100 but I'm visualizing 117 years and [gganimate]{.pkg} will complain (i.e. throw an error) if there aren't enough frames to cover the number of states.

```{r babynames-animated-popular-letter-names, echo=TRUE, fig.show="hide"}
ga_pop_letter <- 
  ggplot(babynames_containing) +
  aes(letter, prop, fill = sex) +
  geom_col(position = "identity", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 10), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = sex_colors) +
  labs(
    x        = NULL,
    y        = "Percent of Population",
    fill     = NULL,
    title    = "How many babies have the letter ____ in their name?",
    subtitle = "{closest_state}",
    caption  = caption_text
  ) +
  base_theme +
  ease_aes("linear") +
  transition_states(
    year, transition_length = 1, state_length = 0, wrap = FALSE
  )

ga_pop_letter_animated <- animate(
  ga_pop_letter, 
  nframes = 117*2+10, 
  end_pause = 10,
  width = 1024, 
  height = 512
)
```

```{r babynames-any-letter, include=FALSE}
ga_pop_letter_animated
```

The resulting animation, below, shows the proportion of babies given a name containing (at least one of) each letter of the alphabet since 1900.

`r lightbox_img(knitr::fig_chunk("babynames-any-letter", "gif"))`

```{r eval=FALSE}
g2 <- ggplot(babynames_containing) +
  aes(year, prop, color = sex) +
  geom_text(
    data = babynames_containing %>% 
      distinct(year, letter) %>% 
      mutate(prop = 0, year2 = 1967),
    aes(label = letter, x = year2),
    size = rel(15),
    vjust = -0.4,
    color = "grey75"
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(group = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~ letter, ncol = 6) +
  labs(x = "1917 - 2017") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(1900, 2017, by = 50), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(10),
    expand = c(0, 0, 0.05, 0)
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male" = "#00589A", "Female" = "#EB1455")) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "grey90")
  )
```

## First and Last Letters of Baby Names

To extract the first and last letter of each name, I wrote two small functions, `first_letter()` and `last_letter()` that use `substring()` to pull out the first and last letter of a string.
These are reasonably fast when applied to all of the names using `map_chr()` from [purrr]{.pkg} within `mutate()` to add new columns `first_letter` and `last_letter`.

```{r babynames_first_last, echo=TRUE}
first_letter <- function(x) substring(x, 1, 1)
last_letter  <- function(x) substring(x, nchar(x), nchar(x))

babynames_first_last <- 
  babynames %>% 
  mutate(
    first_letter = map_chr(name, first_letter),
    last_letter  = map_chr(name, last_letter),
  ) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(contains("letter")), tolower)

set.seed(42)
babynames_first_last %>% sample_n(6)
```

### Animated

First, let's look at the animated version of my remix of Kieran's plots.
You can still see the change in the use of **N** as a final letter in the names given to baby boys, as he described, but you also see the changes in female names as well.

`r lightbox_img(knitr::fig_chunk("babynames-last-animation", "gif"))`

Here's the code I used to produce the plot above.

```{r echo=TRUE}
gb_last <-
  babynames_first_last %>% 
  filter(year >= 1900) %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = "Male", F = "Female")) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, last_letter) %>% 
  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(last_letter, prop, fill = sex) +
  geom_col(position = "identity", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 10), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = sex_colors) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percent of Population",
    fill = NULL,
    title = "How many baby names end with the letter ____?",
    subtitle = "{closest_state}",
    caption = caption_text
  ) +
  base_theme +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.9)) +
  ease_aes("linear") +
  transition_states(
    year, 
    transition_length = 1, 
    state_length = 0, wrap = FALSE
  )

gb_last_animated <- animate(
  gb_last, 
  nframes = 117*2+10, 
  end_pause = 10,
  width = 1024, height = 512 
)
```


```{r babynames-last-animation, include=FALSE}
gb_last_animated
```

Then I also created a similar visualization for the starting letters of baby's names.

`r lightbox_img(knitr::fig_chunk("babynames-first-animation", "gif"))`

And here's the code to create the above animation.

```{r echo=TRUE}
gb_first <-
  babynames_first_last %>% 
  filter(year >= 1900) %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = "Male", F = "Female")) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, first_letter) %>% 
  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(first_letter, prop, fill = sex) +
  geom_col(position = "identity", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 10), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = sex_colors) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percent of Population",
    fill = NULL,
    title = "How many baby names start with the letter ____?",
    subtitle = "{closest_state}",
    caption = caption_text
  ) +
  base_theme +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.9)) +
  ease_aes("linear") +
  transition_states(
    year, 
    transition_length = 1, 
    state_length = 0, 
    wrap = FALSE
  )

gb_first_animated <- animate(
  gb_first, 
  nframes = 117*2+10, 
  end_pause = 10,
  width = 1024, height = 512
)
```

```{r babynames-first-animation, include=FALSE}
gb_first_animated
```


### Static

I'll admit, I think the animated plots are cool,
but they're also make it hard to reason about overall trends.
You have to watch the animation loop over and over, trying to watch one letter or one sex specifically.
I feel like I'm seeing the movement but missing the picture.

I thought it would be interesting to compare the animated plots with line charts showing the same information, so I swapped [gganimate]{.pkg}'s `transition_state(year)` for [ggplot2]{.pkg}'s `facet_wrap(~ letter)`.

I somewhat like these plots more than their animated versions.
I get the sense that I'm seeing a fuller picture (or more easily compared picture) of the overall trends in starting and ending letters of baby names.

`r lightbox_img(knitr::fig_chunk("babynames-last-static", "png"))`

`r lightbox_img(knitr::fig_chunk("babynames-first-static", "png"))`

Here's the code to produce the static image of the trends in the last letter of baby names.

```{r babynames-last-static, echo=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, dependson="theme", fig.show="hide"}
babynames_first_last %>% 
  filter(year >= 1900) %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = "Male", F = "Female")) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, last_letter) %>% 
  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(last_letter = toupper(last_letter)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(year, prop) +
  geom_text(
    data = tibble(
      last_letter = LETTERS, 
      x = 1900+117/2, 
      prop = 0
    ),
    aes(label = last_letter, x = x),
    size = rel(15),
    vjust = -0.12,
    color = "grey75",
    family = "PT Sans"
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~ last_letter) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(5), 
    breaks = c(0, 0.3)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1900, 2000)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = sex_colors) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Proportion of Population",
    title = "How many babies have names ending with the letter ____?",
    caption = caption_text,
    color = NULL
  ) +
  base_theme +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "plain"),
    legend.position = c(0.7, 0.025),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )
```

And here is the code to produce the plot of trends in the first letter of baby names.

```{r babynames-first-static, echo=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, dependson="theme", fig.show="hide"}
babynames_first_last %>% 
  filter(year >= 1900) %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = "Male", F = "Female")) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, first_letter) %>% 
  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(first_letter = toupper(first_letter)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(year, prop) +
  geom_text(
    data = tibble(
      first_letter = LETTERS, 
      x = 1900+117/2, 
      prop = 0
    ),
    aes(label = first_letter, x = x),
    size = rel(15),
    vjust = -0.2,
    color = "grey75",
    family = "PT Sans"
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~ first_letter) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(5), 
    breaks = c(0, 0.2)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1900, 2000)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = sex_colors) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Proportion of Population",
    title = "How many babies have names starting with the letter ____?",
    caption = caption_text,
    color = NULL
  ) +
  base_theme +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "plain"),
    legend.position = c(0.7, 0.025),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )
```
