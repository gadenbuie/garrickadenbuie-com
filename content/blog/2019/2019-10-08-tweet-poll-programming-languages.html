<!----------- POST START ----------->
<p>An informal poll about experiences with programming languages has been making the rounds on Twitter this week.
It all started with <a href="https://twitter.com/cotufa82/status/1179601883448655874">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/cotufa82/">@cotufa82</a>:</p>
<div class="center">
{{% tweet "1179601883448655874" %}}
</div>
<p>The tweet caught on within a few days
and there are now more than
16,840
replies and quote tweets from developers and programmers
sharing their own experiences.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2019/2019-10-08-tweet-poll-programming-languages_files/figure-html/tweets-per-day-1.svg" width="864" /></p>
<p>My interest in the poll was piqued by another tweet by
<a href="https://twitter.com/edsu/status/1180844062552858624">@edsu</a>
sharing a
<a href="https://github.com/edsu/notebooks/blob/c5aad3555adfbf7c63dcd968f7b4a73ce11820b5/Languages.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>
analyzing the tweeted responses.
I thought it would be interesting
to do a similar analysis using R,
initially thinking I could compare the R and Python versions.</p>
<p>What I should have done is to have used <em>both</em> R and Python
(because they’re friends and language wars are silly),
but instead I ended up going down the endless rabbit hole
of regular expressions and free-form informal survey results.</p>
<div id="gather-the-tweets" class="section level2">
<h2>Gather the Tweets</h2>
<p>I gathered all tweets containing <code>"first language"</code>, <code>"most used"</code>, and <code>"most loved"</code>
using the excellent <a href="https://rtweet.info">rtweet</a> package by <a href="https://mikewk.com/">Mike Kearney</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tweets &lt;- rtweet::search_tweets(
  &#39;&quot;first language&quot; AND &quot;most used&quot; AND &quot;most loved&quot;&#39;,

<div id="whose-tweets-were-the-most-popular" class="section level2">
<h2>Whose Tweets Were The Most Popular?</h2>
<p>15,025
people replied to or quoted a tweet to answer the poll.
Here are the top contributors to the popularity of the tweet,
in the form of the top 10 recipients of a reply or quote tweet.</p>

<h2>Our Experience with Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Let’s dive into the results.
If you’re interested in taking a peek behind the regular expressions curtain, I’ve included a <a href="#code-walkthrough">code walkthrough</a> below.</p>
<p>The original tweet asked for six categories: <strong>First language</strong>, <strong>Had difficulties</strong>, <strong>Most used</strong>, <strong>Totally hate</strong>, <strong>Most loved</strong>, <strong>For beginners</strong>.
Replies to this tweet were… creative.
The category names and formatting were hand-typed, so flexible and prone to spelling errors and permutations.</p>
<p>To get the broadest range of answers possible,
I used flexible regular expressions to accept a variety of formatting choices,
and I also widened the categories to encompass the same core themes.
For example,
<code>first love</code>, <code>secret love</code>, and <code>mostly loved</code>
all were added to the <strong>Most loved</strong> category,
which I called, simply, <strong>love</strong>.</p>
<p>I also captured multiple programming languages in each category
(even the <a href="https://twitter.com/cotufa82/status/1179601883448655874">original tweet</a> had multiple answers for first language (Basic/Java) and a few other categories).</p>
<p>Each of the following plots shows the top 20 responses in each category.</p>
<div id="first-language-vs.-recommended-first-language" class="section level3">
<h3>First Language vs. Recommended First Language</h3>
<p>How do the first languages learned by programmers
compare to the languages <em>they</em> would recommend to <em>others</em>
to learn first?
Many people started with older languages
like Basic, C, Pascal, C++ and Java
but would recommend new programmers start with Python, JavaScript, Ruby and also C or Java.</p>

<div id="love-it-or-hate-it" class="section level3">
<h3>Love It or Hate It</h3>
<p>Which programming languages are loved and which languages are not?
The world seems to have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript,
but Python is much more loved than hated.
Likewise Swift, Ruby, and Go are significantly more positive than negative,
C++ is also a bit love/hate,
and PHP certainly isn’t feeling the love.</p>

</div>
<div id="most-used-or-had-difficulties" class="section level3">
<h3>Most Used or Had Difficulties</h3>
<p>Which languages are most used compared with those that have caused difficulties?
JavaScript is eating the world,
and plenty of people are using workhorse languages like Python, Java and C#/C++.
(And a quite a few are using PHP presumably because they have to.)
Still, JavaScript’s love/hate relationship continues
as many people indicated that it caused them problems.
I’m not surprised to see C++, C, and Java on the <em>had difficulties</em> list.
Interestingly, Haskell shows up in the <em>loved</em> list but seems to also be tricky to learn.</p>

<h3>Feelings about <code>#rstats</code></h3>
<p>How do developers feel about my favorite language?
R isn’t a typical first language,
but it is among the top 20 recommended to new programmers to learn first.
It’s also the
12th
most used language.</p>

<li><p>Pre-clean the tweet text, including <a href="#remove-unused-text">remove_unused_text()</a></p></li>
<li><p>Separate tweets so that each line or item of the tweet is in its own row using <code>tidyr::separate_rows()</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Items are indicated by <code>N.</code>, <code>N)</code>, <code>N:</code>, or <code>N-</code>, or just appear on a new line without numbering.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Remove whitespace and any numbering from each line</p></li>
<li><p>Separate each line into a question <code>category</code> and <code>answer</code> pair by splitting on <code>:</code> using <code>tidyr::separate()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Filter out empty answers and convert everything to lower case</p></li>
<li><p>Use a set of regular expressions to <a href="#process-answer">process_answer()</a> into individual languages</p></li>
<li><p>Use more regular expressions to <a href="#recode-answer">recode_answer()</a> and <a href="#recode-category">recode_category()</a>, fixing spelling mistakes and combining overlapping groups</p></li>
<li><p>Count the number of replies mentioning each programming language by category</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="#tweets-lang-poll">whole pipeline</a> is summarized below,
including the function to <a href="#plot-tweets-by-category">plot response counts by category</a>.</p>
<div id="remove-unused-text" class="section level3">
<h3>Remove Unused Text</h3>
<p>This little function removes usernames (<code>@user</code>),
URLs,
parenthetical comments,
and turns <code>#hashtag</code> into <code>hashtag</code>
because many people specified their choices using language hashtags, like <code>#rstats</code> instead of <code>r</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remove_unused_text &lt;- function(text) {
  text %&gt;%
    # strip usernames
    str_remove_all(&quot;@\\w+\\s*&quot;) %&gt;%
    # strip URLs
    str_remove_all(&quot;\\s*http[^ ]+\\s*&quot;) %&gt;%
    # remove parentheticals
    str_remove_all(&quot;\\s*\\(.+?\\)( |\n|$)&quot;) %&gt;%
    # replace &quot;#hashtag&quot; with &quot;hashtag&quot;
    str_replace_all(&quot;#(\\w)&quot;, &quot;\\1&quot;) 
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="process-answer" class="section level3">
<h3>Process Answer</h3>
<p>The goal in processing the answers is to transform each answer to a single string of comma separated languages.
In doing this, common variations of language lists should result in the same final answers.
For example,
<code>Python and R</code>, <code>Python/R</code>, and <code>Python or R</code> should all be handled similarly.
To help with this process I created a list of common languages that frequently appear in the answers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>common_langs &lt;- c(
  # c, c#, c++, and .net are manually included later
  &quot;css&quot;, &quot;html&quot;, &quot;python&quot;, &quot;javascript&quot;, &quot;x86&quot;, &quot;java&quot;, &quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;pascal&quot;, &quot;php&quot;, 
  &quot;matlab&quot;, &quot;perl&quot;, &quot;fortran&quot;, &quot;logo&quot;, &quot;actionscript&quot;, &quot;lua&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot;,
  &quot;delphi&quot;, &quot;js&quot;, &quot;scheme&quot;, &quot;scratch&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, &quot;typescript&quot;, &quot;clojure&quot;, &quot;elixr&quot;,
  &quot;kotlin&quot;, &quot;ocaml&quot;, &quot;rust&quot;, &quot;mathematica&quot;, &quot;matlab&quot;, &quot;dart&quot;, &quot;flutter&quot;, &quot;groovy&quot;,
  &quot;flash&quot;, &quot;bash&quot;, &quot;shell&quot;, &quot;sql&quot;, &quot;haskell&quot;, &quot;lisp&quot;, &quot;scala&quot;, &quot;sas&quot;,
  &quot;rstats&quot;, &quot;golang&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>Then, with a bit of regex kung fu,
the responses are converted from <code>Python and R</code> to <code>python,r</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>process_answer &lt;- function(answer, common_langs) {
  answer %&gt;%
    # Aggresively remove unusual characters

<h3>Recode Answer</h3>
<p>There are a number of programming languages that have multiple variants
or are commonly referred to by shorthand names —
<code>rstats</code> for <code>R</code> or <code>golang</code> for <code>go</code>, for example.
This function recodes the programming language answers
that I noticed while working with the data
(but it’s admitedly not complete).</p>

<h3>Recode Category</h3>
<p>As you might imagine with a free-form survey
where users manually enter both the question <em>and</em> the answer,
there is a large amount of variation in the spelling and categories used.</p>
<p>I broadly grouped many of the variations into common themes,
primarily working to fit the original prompt.
There are many, many interesting created categories, like <code>best dead language</code>, <code>didn't spark joy</code>, or <code>latest crush</code>.
Here are two additional categories that I created, <code>curious</code> and <code>interesting</code>.</p>

<h3>Plot Language Counts by Category</h3>
<p>Last, but not least,
this function creates the plots for requested categories.
One key detail is that bars are ordered within each facet
using <span class="pkg">tidytext</span>’s <code>reorder_within()</code> function.
Check out Julia Silge’s excellent blog post on this function:
<a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/">Reordering and facetting for ggplot2</a>.</p>
<p>While the bars are ordered in descending order,
I wanted the bar fill color to be consistent across facets
to facilitate comparison between the two categories.
The color palette is <code>ocean.deep</code> from the <span class="pkg">pals</span> package, which I found by looking through
Emil Hvitfeldt’s
<a href="https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes#comprehensive-list-of-color-palettes-in-r">Comprehensive list of color palettes in R</a>.</p>
