## Installing countdown

Installing countdown is now a whole lot easier:

``` r
install.packages("countdown")
```

As always, you can still get the latest and greatest in-development versions
from [GitHub](https://github.com/gadenbuie/countdown)

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/countdown")
```

or from [gadenbuie.r-universe.dev](https://gadenbuie.r-universe.dev/).

``` r
options(repos = c(
  gadenbuie = 'https://gadenbuie.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'
))

install.packages('countdown')
```

## A brief history of countdown

### rstudio::conf(2019)

In 2019 I went to rstudio::conf in Austin TX
and took an awesome workshop by Garrett Grolemund and Greg Wilson about teaching.
That workshop specifically marked a turning point in my career
and I left rstudio::conf very inspired to build and teach cool things in R.

My other key takeaway from rstudio::conf(2019) was that it was time to learn JavaScript ‚Äî
an odd thing to take away from an R conference.
(Although I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in this;
this year many people walked away from rstudio::conf(2022) thinking that it was time to learn Python.)

These two inspirations came together in my first post-conf project:
a countdown timer for xaringan slides.
Garrett used these extensively to pace break out sessions
and they worked surprisingly well to keep everyone on track.

<div class="fr-ns ph4" style="max-width:22rem">

![A slide from Garrett‚Äôs workshop materials with a 4-minute timer in the lower right corner.](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/countdown/img/teach-tidyverse-timer.png)

</div>

One funny thing I noticed during our workshop session
was that Garrett would frequently have to switch to slide-edit mode (in Keynote, I think)
to fiddle with the timer as he adjusted the length of the ‚Äúyour turn‚Äù session.
This isn‚Äôt abnormal;
an instructor probably has a sense of approximately how long an activity will take
and we‚Äôll often will adjust the time spent on the activity
based on how the audience is doing,
how well the material is working,
or how close to lunch or break we are in the session.

So my idea was to build a countdown timer
that you could drop into a slide
and easily use to time an event.
I also wanted to make it easy to adjust the time,
but my JavaScript skills were limited to what I could learn from StackOverflow,
so I compromised and decided that you could only bump the timer up.
If you had to move faster, you could just move on.

### It becomes an R package

I cobbled together an R package
that was basically a decent R interface
around a collection of lines of JavaScript that I barely understood,
that somehow assembled into an actual working timer.
I made a cool [intro-slash-docs presentation](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/countdown)
and would probably have sat on it for a while longer
if Mara Averick hadn‚Äôt spotted my GitHub activity
and [soft-announced the package for me](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1125747630489911297).

Not long after that,
and slightly to my horror (*please don‚Äôt go looking at my JavaScript code*),
[Hadley submitted an issue](https://github.com/gadenbuie/countdown/issues/5).
Actually, [two issues](https://github.com/gadenbuie/countdown/issues/6).
Obviously, that was an exciting turn of events,
and his suggestions were solid and helped improve the quality of the timer.
(He suggested a ‚Äúwarning state‚Äù and a full-screen view/app.)

Amazingly, it worked!
People really seemed to like the package,
it solved a silly but useful need that many people have when teaching,
and it let me learn a ton about how to build htmlwidgets in R.
I‚Äôm proud of the R interface ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to use and configure ‚Äî
and I think the feature set hits the right balance of
looking good right out of the box
without doing *too much*.

### But that JavaScript code‚Ä¶

Since I wrote countdown,
I‚Äôve learned a whole lot more JavaScript
and I know a whole lot more about how htmlwidgets can be built in R.
countdown‚Äôs underlying code has always haunted me a little in the back of my mind,
but on the other hand it was chugging away,
still working fine for most people in most situations.

So I left it alone‚Ä¶

![Screenshot of the countdown GitHub repository page where the phrase ‚Äú3 years ago‚Äù is highlighted. That is GitHub‚Äôs summary of the last time I updated countdown.](countdown-history-3-years.png)

‚Ä¶for almost 3 years.

This year, [rstudio::conf](https://rstudio.com/conference),
and wow, a lot has changed in those three years.
Not only did I lead a workshop *about JavaScript* for Shiny users
[\#js4shiny](https://js4shiny.com) at rstudio::conf(2020),
and not only do I now work for RStudio,
but I was also part of the program committee for conference planning.
Which means I saw colleagues were still using my countdown timer in workshop slides.

And that old franken-JavaScript code still haunted me.

<style type="text/css">
.superlative {
  border-bottom: 1px dashed;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.superlative:hover {
  color: var(--red-60);
}
.slide-preview {
  max-width: 480px;
}
</style>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.querySelector('.superlative').addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  const superlatives = [
    'delighted', 'charmed', 'elated', 'excited', 'pleased', 'thrilled', 'chuffed',
    'tickled pink', 'overjoyed', 'ecstatic', 'stoked', 'proud', 'fired up'
  ]
  const el = ev.target
  const idx = Math.floor(Math.random() * superlatives.length)
  el.innerText = superlatives[idx]
})
</script>
