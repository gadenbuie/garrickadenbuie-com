## Choose your own pull request adventure

Welcome to this choose-your-own-adventure blog post.
You don't need to read this one from top to bottom.
Instead, jumping around is encouraged!
Just look for the `r way_point(FALSE)` icon.

### Start here {#start}

You open your project in RStudio (or the editor of your choice).
You make a note to yourself to come up with a better name for your package —
for now you're calling it [acme]{.pkg} 
because it's mostly a collection of random functions you've written.

Anyway, you're thankful that you closed all of your open files the last time you were working,
but now the empty console beckons.
You're ready to do some work.

Where do you begin? With [[usethis]]{.pkg} of course.

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(usethis)
```

::: {#start-here}
`r way_point()` Now you face a harder decision: what do you actually do next?

1. [Start new work](#start-new-work)

1. [Pick up something you were working on](#resume-my-work)

1. [Review someone else's work](#review-others-work)
:::

### Start new work {#start-new-work}

Time to start something new.
You scan your project board, issues list, JIRA tickets, slack messages, emails, and post-it notes
and finally settle on something to work on.
Your task: add an example to the documentation for a function you've been working on.

::: {#pr-init}
You want to start your work in a new branch,
so you call `pr_init()`,
giving it the name of your new branch.

```{r pr-init, eval=FALSE}
pr_init("add-example")
```
```
✓ Setting active project to '/Users/garrick/work/acme'
ℹ Pulling changes from 'upstream/main'
✓ Creating and switching to local branch 'add-example'
● Use `pr_push()` to create PR.
```
:::

The console output reminds you that [usethis]{.pkg} updated your local repo
and created and switched to a new branch for you.

`r way_point()` You're ready to [do some work](#do-work).

### Pick up something you were working on {#resume-my-work}

resume your local work

### Review someone else's work {#review-others-work}

review others works

## Do some work {#do-work}

You take a sip of your coffee (or the beverage of your choice),
turn up your favorite [music to write code to](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1fk6kpO8nb1KAUc1XAkAJ6) playlist on Spotify,
and line up 25 minutes in your [Pomodoro app](https://pomofocus.io/).

You're ready to get something done!
Go write some code.

`r way_point()` When you feel good about your work,
come back here and we'll [take a snapshot of your updates](#git-commit).

### Take a snapshot of your work {#git-commit}

Feeling okay about your code? 
Take a snapshot of it!

There are two parts to this step.
First, you'll pick the files that you want to add to the snapshot (or commit).
You can do this in the R console using `git_add()` from the [[gert]]{.pkg} package.
Give the function a vector with the paths to the files you changed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gert::git_add(c("R/atom_arranger.R", "man/atom_arranger.Rd"))
```

Running this command is like asking a friend to step into the picture.
We haven't officially taken a snapshot of your changes yet,
but we now we have the changes in frame.
In git-speak, 
`git_add()` adds the changes in the listed files to a staging area.

Then, once all the files you want to commit have been added,
you _commit_ the changes.
In our picture-taking metaphor,
committing is a lot like taking a snapshot of your friends.

Along with the changes in the staged files,
the commit includes a message,
which you give as a parameter to `git_commit()` 
(also from the [[gert]]{.pkg} package).
Think of this message like the subject of an email to your future self.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gert::git_commit("Add an example to ?atom_arranger()")
```

_P.S. You can do this adding-and-committing dance in the [Git pane in RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html), too._

`r way_point()` Are you ready to share your work?

- If **yes**, then you're ready to [push your changes out into the world](#share-your-work).

- If **not**, no worries. Just [keep on working](#do-work).

### Fix something {#fix-something}

`r way_point()` Need to fix something? Let's do a quick check.
This thing that needs to be fixed — what branch is it in?

- The one I'm in right now<br/>
  &rArr; _keep reading_

- A local branch, but not the one I'm in now<br/>
  &rArr; _go [resume working in that branch](#pr-resume)
  and then come right back here._

- A pull request branch I was looking at on GitHub<br/>
  &rArr; _go [fetch the pull request](#pr-fetch)
  and then come right back here_.
  
`r way_point()` Great, you're all set to make that fix.
Once you're happy with your changes, 
[take a snapshot of the fix](#git-commit).

## Share your work {#share-your-work}

Fantastic!
Your work is awesome and everyone is going to be happy to try it out,
but first you have to get it off of your computer and out into the world.

`r way_point()` Is this [new work](#pr-push-new) you're sharing,
or are you [updating an existing pull request](#pr-push) with either your own or someone else's work?

### Create a new pull request {#pr-push-new}

To create a new pull request, you call `pr_push()`.

```{r pr-push, eval=FALSE}
pr_push()
```
```
✔ Pushing local 'add-example' branch to 'origin:add-example'
✔ Setting upstream tracking branch for 'add-example' to 'origin/formidable'
✔ Create PR at link given below
✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/gadenbuie/acme/compare/add-example'
```
</div>

`pr_push()` sends the local changes in your new branch to GitHub,
and opens a browser window where you can review your changes once more.
If everything looks good, 
go ahead click the _Create Pull Request_ button.

`r way_point()` Good job! How are you feeling now?

- I'm on a roll, let's [start the next thing](#pr-pause).

- Oh shoot, [I saw something I need to fix](#fix-something).

## Wrap Up

### Pause your work {#pr-pause}

If you landed here, 
you're not completely done with the thing you were working on,
but you do want to put it aside for now.
That's alright, that work will be waiting patiently for you in a local branch.

Call `pr_pause()` to switch from the current branch back to the default branch,
and to make sure you've got the latest changes in the default branch.

```{r eval=FALSE}
pr_pause()
```
```
✓ Switching back to default branch ('main')
✓ Pulling changes from 'origin/main'
```

`r way_point()` [Go back to Start](#start-here) to decide what's next in your adventure.

### Finish your work {#pr-finish}

Congrats! Your pull request was merged or your review of someone else's work is complete!
That's awesome.
Now it's time to wrap things up by calling `pr_finish()`.

```{r pr_finish, eval=FALSE}
pr_finish()
```

`r way_point()` [Go back to Start](#start-here) to decide what's next in your adventure.
