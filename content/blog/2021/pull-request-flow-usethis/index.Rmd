## Choose your own pull request adventure {#intro}

TK: intro about [usethis]{.pkg} and `pr_*()` helper functions.

Welcome to this choose-your-own-adventure blog post.
<span id="instructions">You don't need to read this one from top to bottom.
Instead, jumping around is encouraged!</span>

Look for the `r way_point(FALSE)` icon.
It tells you that it's time for you make a choice.
But don't worry, there's no wrong choice:
if you take a wrong turn
you can always use your browser's `r back_button()` button
to retrace your steps.

::: decision
`r way_point()` Ready to get started?

<ul id="intro-options">
<li><p>Yes, [I'm ready to go](#get-started)!</p></li>
</ul>
:::

## {#story-container}

<div id="story" aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="additions"></div>

## Prep work {.step}

### Let's get started {#get-started .step}

You open your project in RStudio (or the editor of your choice).
You make a note to yourself to come up with a better name for your package —
for now you're calling it [acme]{.pkg} 
because it's mostly a collection of random functions you've written.

Anyway, you're thankful that you closed all of your open files the last time you were working,
but now the empty console beckons.
You're ready to do some work.

Where do you begin? With [[usethis]]{.pkg} of course.

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(usethis)
```

::: decision
`r way_point()` That was easy! [Lets do some work now.](#start)
:::

### What's next? {#start .step}

::: {.decision}
`r way_point()` Now you face a tough decision: what do you actually do next?

- [Start new work](#pr-init)

- [Pick up something you were working on](#pr-resume)

- [Review or collaborate with someone else's work](#pr-fetch-review)

- [Clean up after a PR that's been merged](#pr-finish-start)
:::

### Start new work {#pr-init .step}

Time to start something new.
You scan your project board, issues list, JIRA tickets, slack messages, emails, and post-it notes
and finally settle on something to work on.
Your task: add an example to the documentation for a function you've been working on.

You want to start your work in a new branch,
so you call `pr_init()`,
giving it the name of your new branch.

```{r pr-init, eval=FALSE}
pr_init("add-example")
```
```
✓ Setting active project to '/Users/garrick/work/acme'
ℹ Pulling changes from 'upstream/main'
✓ Creating and switching to local branch 'add-example'
● Use `pr_push()` to create PR.
```

The console output reminds you that [usethis]{.pkg} updated your local repo
and created and switched to a new branch for you.

::: decision
`r way_point()` You're ready to [do some work](#do-work).
:::

### Pick up something you were working on {#pr-resume .step}

You're ready to get back to that thing you were working on.
Which was what again?
You should probably have another sip of your coffee.
You were doing some work in a branch in your local of the project...

::: decision
`r way_point()` Do you remember the name of the branch?

- [I don't remember, remind me](#pr-resume-no-branch)

- [I remember, it's the `add-example` branch](#pr-resume-branch)
:::

### Get to a local branch {#pr-resume-local .step}

git branches, you've made a few.
But which one you do you want to work in?

::: decision
`r way_point()` Do you remember the name of the branch?

- [I don't remember, remind me](#pr-resume-no-branch)

- [I remember, it's the `add-example` branch](#pr-resume-branch)
:::

### Choose a branch and resume working {#pr-resume-no-branch .step}

Don't worry, [usethis]{.pkg} has your back.
Just run `pr_resume()` without any arguments
to get a list of local branches available to you.
`pr_resume()` helpfully sorts the branches by recency of work
and tells you if any of the branches are related to pull requests.

```{r pr_resume-no-branch, eval=FALSE}
pr_resume()
```
```
ℹ No branch specified ... looking up local branches and associated PRs
Which branch do you want to checkout? (0 to exit)

1:         add-example --> #11 ('@gadenbuie'): Add an example
2: feature-exploration

Selection: 1
✓ Switching to branch 'add-example'
✓ Pulling from 'origin/add-example'
• Use `pr_push()` to create or update PR.
```

We picked option `1` to keep working in our `add-example` branch.
Notice that, since `add-example` is related to PR `#11`,
`pr_resume()` also did you the extra favor of
making sure that your local copy is up-to-date.

::: decision
`r way_point()` Rock and roll, you're ready to [get back to work](#do-work-yours).
:::

### Get back to the branch {#pr-resume-branch .step}

Look at you, smarty pants. 
You remember your git branch names!
I'm proud of you.

Good news, 
`pr_resume()` can switch to `"add-example"` branch for you
and it also makes sure that your local copy is up-to-date!

```{r pr_resume-branch, eval=FALSE}
pr_resume("add-example")
```
```
✓ Switching to branch 'add-example'
✓ Pulling from 'origin/add-example'
• Use `pr_push()` to create or update PR.
```

::: decision
`r way_point()` Sweat deal! Okay, you're ready to [keep on working](#do-work-yours).
:::

### Review or collaborate with someone else's work {#pr-fetch-review .step}

Version control software like git
and collaborative coding platforms like GitHub
are plenty of fun when you're working on your own.
But they really start to shine when you use them to collaborate with others.

The same is true for the [usethis]{.pkg} PR helper functions.
Setting up your local repo to pull down the changes from a collaborator --
changes that probably live in a branch in _their copy_ of the repo --
can be a frustrating experience full of online searching
to remember the specific incantations required
to get your collaborators onto your computer and open in front of you.

But have no fear,
`pr_fetch()` does all of this for you,
in just one command in your R console.

::: decision
`r way_point()` Do you know the pull request number?

- [I don't remember, remind me](#pr-fetch-no-branch)

- [I remember, it's PR `#14`](#pr-fetch-branch)
:::

### Open a remote branch, locally {#pr-fetch .step}

The pull request is open on GitHub
and you can see the changes there,
but you just can't interact with the code in the same way through the browser.
You have to bring that code into your local IDE
where you can hold it in your hand
and poke it with debuggers.

::: decision
`r way_point()` Do you know the pull request number?

- [I don't remember, remind me.](#pr-fetch-no-branch)

- [I remember, it's PR `#14`.](#pr-fetch-branch)
:::

### Choose a PR and bring the changes onto your computer {#pr-fetch-no-branch .step}

Your friend,
who affectionately calls themselves `@wileycoyote` on GitHub,
helpfully contributed a new function
to your bag of tricks package, [acme]{.pkg}.
They sent you a message on Slack letting you know they submitted a PR,
but they didn't mention the PR number.

No a big deal —
you can call `pr_fetch()` from your local repository
without any arguments
and [usethis]{.pkg} will look up any open pull requests
and give you the option to pick the one you want.

```{r pr_fetch-no-branch, eval=FALSE}
pr_fetch()
```
```
ℹ No PR specified ... looking up open PRs
Which PR are you interested in? (0 to exit) 

1: 'gadenbuie/acme/#11' (@gadenbuie): 'Add an example'
2: 'gadenbuie/acme/#14' (@wileycoyote): 'Model tuning features'

Selection: 2
✓ Checking out PR 'gadenbuie/acme/#14' (@wileycoyote): 'Model tuning features'
✓ Adding remote 'wileycoyote' as 'git@github.com:wileycoyote/acme.git'
✓ Creating and switching to local branch 'wileycoyote-toone-model'
✓ Setting 'wileycoyote/toone-model' as remote tracking branch
```

You find your friend's PR in the list and choose selection `2`.
Next time you can perform the same steps by providing the PR number —
`pr_fetch(14)` —
or you can use the menu again.
Who has time or brain space to memorize pull request numbers?

Now that you have the code from the PR available to you locally, 
you're free to poke around to try out the code and review it.

::: decision
`r way_point()` Okay, you've had a chance to look at the code, what do you want to do next?

- [I want to make some changes to add to the PR.](#do-work-theirs)

- I reviewed the code and left comments for the PR authors in the pull request.

   - [I'm done with this branch](#pr-forget-theirs).
   
   - [I'm done for now, but I'll probably come back to this branch later](#pr-pause).
:::

### Open a PR locally {#pr-fetch-branch .step}

You've been working with your friend, 
`@wileycoyote`,
on a new set of model tuning functions.
They've helpfully started working on a PR,
but since you've been reviewing the code carefully
with them over the past few days,
you actually remember the pull request number.
Lucky number **14**.

```{r pr_fetch-branch, eval=FALSE}
pr_fetch(14)
```
```
✓ Checking out PR 'gadenbuie/acme/#14' (@wileycoyote): 'Model tuning features'
✓ Switching to branch 'wileycoyote-toone-model'
```

You already have a copy of the PR branch in your local project,
so `pr_fetch()` simply switched you into
the `wileycoyote-toone-model` branch
that it created when you first fetched the PR.

Because you might have been doing some work here before,
`pr_fetch()` does not try to update your local branch.
But you haven't done any work yet other than looking at the code,
so you follow up with `pr_pull()` to pull the latest changes into your project.

```{r pr_fetch-pr_pull, eval=FALSE}
pr_pull()
```
```
✓ Pulling from 'wileycoyote/toone-model'
```

::: decision
`r way_point()` Now that you have the latest PR code, what do you want to do next?

- [I want to make some changes to add to the PR.](#do-work-theirs)

- I reviewed the code and left comments for the PR authors in the pull request.

   - [I'm done with this branch](#pr-forget-theirs).
   
   - [I'm done for now, but I'll probably come back to this branch later](#pr-pause).
:::

## Update your local copy {#do-update .step}

TK: [get to the right branch](#do-choose-branch) and then choose `pr_pull()` or `pr_merge_main()`

### Update your local copy with a reviewer's changes {#pr-pull .step}

Maybe a reviewer [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#applying-a-suggested-change)
and you merged them from the PR page on GitHub.
Maybe a GitHub actions workflow
[automatically re-styled your code](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/pr-commands.yaml#L45-L75).
Or maybe you did a little side-project updating on your work computer.

However the changes happened,
the code in the PR branch has changed,
and now you want to `pr_pull()` those changes into your local copy.

```{r pr_pull, eval=FALSE}
pr_pull()
```
```
✓ Pulling from 'origin/add-example'
```

::: decision
`r way_point()` That was easy! What's next?

- I'm going to [write some code in this branch](#do-work-yours).

- I'm going to put this down and [work on something else](#pr-pause).

- I just merged this pull request and [I'm all done with this work](#pr-finish-yours).
:::

### Update your local copy with someone else's changes {#pr-pull-theirs .step}

Changes were made and hopefully the code has been improved,
but you'd like to run through the changes yourself
to make sure it works as expected.

Use `pr_pull()` to get the latest changes from the PR branch into your local copy.

```{r pr_pull-theirs, eval=FALSE}
pr_pull()
```
```
✓ Pulling from 'wileycoyote/toone-model'
```

::: decision
`r way_point()` That was easy! What's next?

- I'm going to [write some code in this branch](#do-work-theirs).

- I'm going to put this down and [work on something else](#pr-pause).

- That's all I wanted to do, I can [forget about this PR now](#pr-forget-theirs).

- I just merged this pull request and [I'm all done with this work](#pr-finish-theirs).
:::

### Bring your work up to date with the main branch {#pr-merge-main .step}

```{r pr_merge_main, eval=FALSE}
pr_merge_main()
```
```
✓ Pulling changes from 'origin/main' (default branch of source repo)
Merged origin/main into add-example
```


### Get to the right place {#do-choose-branch .step}

Let's make sure we're in the right branch in your local project.

::: decision
`r way_point()` 
Which branch do you want to work with right now?

- The one I'm in right now, so

## Work {.step}

### Do some work {#do-work .step}

You take a sip of your coffee (or the beverage of your choice),
turn up your favorite
[music to write code to](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1fk6kpO8nb1KAUc1XAkAJ6)
playlist on Spotify,
and line up 25 minutes in your [Pomodoro app](https://pomofocus.io/).

Sometimes the best thing you can do to solve a problem is give it some time.
Go for a walk, read something engaging, talk to a friend, take a shower.

And now you're back with fresh eyes, more energy and a full cup of coffee.
Things go better!
You fall easily into a flow and start writing some code.
As you go,
you periodically pause to stage files with `gert::git_add()`
or to commit batches of changes with `gert::git_commit()`.

After a bit you surprise yourself when you realize
that the thing you couldn't figure out when you were tired yesterday
you've knocked out in an hour.

::: decision
`r way_point()`
Happy with your progress, you're ready [update the PR with your latest changes](#pr-push-yours).
:::


### Collaborate with someone else {#do-work-theirs .step}

This is exciting!
Your friend —
which feels like a totally natural way to describe `@wileycoyote`,
a person you know primarily from Twitter —
had a pretty cool idea
and you're feeling the buzz of inspiration.
Even though they started the pull request,
you're about to riff on the ideas they started laying down.

You pick out your [favorite RStudio theme](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/rsthemes/)
and turn up your favorite dance-slash-coding-slash-singing-out-loud music.

As you work,
you pause occasionally to stage files with `gert::git_add()`
and to commit them with `gert::git_commit()`.
Since you're working with someone else,
you remember to 
[write good commit messages](https://xkcd.com/1296/),
but since you're having fun you also use 
[gitmoji to give each commit a good emoji.](https://gitmoji.dev/)

It's a lot later than you expect when you start wrapping up.
That's okay, `@wileycoyote` is going to be stoked to see what you've been working on!

::: decision
`r way_point()`
Go head and [update the PR with your latest changes](#pr-push-theirs).
:::

### Take a snapshot of your work {#git-commit .step}

_If you like it then you shoulda made a `git commit`._

There are two parts to taking a snapshot of your code.
And really, 
it's less like taking a picture and more like sending yourself an email
with a copy of your files.

First, you'll pick the files that you want to add to the snapshot (or commit).
You can do this in the R console using `git_add()` from the [[gert]]{.pkg} package.
Give the function a vector with the paths to the files you changed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gert::git_add(c("R/atom_arranger.R", "man/atom_arranger.Rd"))
```

In git-speak, 
`git_add()` adds the changes in the listed files to a staging area.
Running this command is like dragging a file into the email you're writing.
We haven't officially sent that email yet,
but we have a copy ready to go.
By the way,
you can still make more changes to the file
knowing that there's a temporary copy in that email draft
in case anything goes wrong.

Then, once all the files you want to commit have been added,
you _commit_ the changes.
In our email metaphor,
committing is a lot like pressing send on the email.

And just like an email, 
the commit includes a message
where you can describe the updates you made to the files in the email (commit).

For this step you can use
`git_commit()` 
(also from the [[gert]]{.pkg} package)
which takes the commit message as a parameter.
Think of this message like the subject of an email to your future self.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gert::git_commit("Add an example to ?atom_arranger()")
```

_P.S. You can do this adding-and-committing dance in the [Git pane in RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html), too._

### Create a new pull request {#pr-push-new .step}

Fantastic!
Your work is awesome and everyone is going to be happy to try it out.

Let's get your work off of your computer and out into the world.
To create a new pull request, you call `pr_push()`.

```{r pr-push-new, eval=FALSE}
pr_push()
```
```
✔ Pushing local 'add-example' branch to 'origin:add-example'
✔ Setting upstream tracking branch for 'add-example' to 'origin/add-example'
✔ Create PR at link given below
✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/gadenbuie/acme/compare/add-example'
```

`pr_push()` sends the local changes in your new branch to GitHub,
and opens a browser window where you can review your changes once more.
If everything looks good, 
go ahead click the _Create Pull Request_ button.

::: decision
`r way_point()` Good job! How are you feeling now?

- I'm on a roll, let's [start the next thing](#pr-pause).

- Oh shoot, [I saw something I need to fix](#fix-something).

- Great, that pull request was just merged and [I'm done with this work](#pr-finish-yours).

- Changes were made in the PR [and now I need to update my local copy](#pr-pull).

- Actually, the pull request was closed and [I can forget about this work](#pr-forget-yours).
:::

### Update your existing pull request {#pr-push-yours .step}

You just made [and committed](#git-commit) some changes to an existing pull request,
and now you'd like to update the PR on GitHub.
`pr_push()` also does this for you!
Helpfully, before it pushes it checks to make sure your local branch is up-to-date.

```{r pr-push, eval=FALSE}
pr_push()
```
```
✔ Checking that local branch 'feature-exploration' has the changes in 'origin/feature-exploration'
✔ Pushing local 'feature-exploration' branch to 'origin:feature-exploration'
✔ View PR at 'https://github.com/gadenbuie/acme/pull/10' or call `pr_view()`
```

::: decision
`r way_point()` Phenomenal! What do you want to do next?

- Rock on! I'm moving on to [start the next thing](#pr-pause).

- Wait a second, [I saw something I need to fix](#fix-something-yours).

- Changes were made in the PR [and now I need to update my local copy](#pr-pull).

- I just merged this PR and [I'm all done with this work](#pr-finish-yours).

- Never mind, my [PR was closed and I'd like to forget about this work](#pr-forget-yours).
:::

### Update someone else's pull request {#pr-push-theirs .step}

At this point,
you have changes in your local copy of your PR branch
that you need to push out to the source branch for the PR,
which happens to be in `@wileycoyote`'s fork of your repo.

`pr_push()` is very smart and knows how to send the changes to the correct repository,
pushing to the `toone-model` in the `wileycoyote/acme`.

```{r pr-push-theirs, eval=FALSE}
pr_push()
```
```
✔ Checking that local branch 'wileycoyote-toone-model' has the changes in 'wileycoyote/toone-model'
✔ Pushing local 'wileycoyote-toone-model' branch to 'wilecoyote:toone-model'
✔ View PR at 'https://github.com/gadenbuie/acme/pull/14' or call `pr_view()`
```

::: decision

- Beep, beep! I'm moving on to [start the next thing](#pr-pause).

- Hang on, [I saw something I need to fix](#fix-something-theirs).

- That's all I wanted to do, I can [forget about this PR now](#pr-forget-theirs).

## Wrap Up {.step}

### Pause your work {#pr-pause .step}

You're done but you have a feeling you'll be back here again soon.
What you need is a little _pause_.

Call `pr_pause()` to switch from the current branch back to the default branch,
and to make sure you've got the latest changes in the default branch.
Don't worry,
the work will be waiting patiently for you in a local branch
when you're ready to come back to it.

Hooray!
A PR was merged and the new code is now in the default branch.
That's one less branch you need to keep around on your computer.

### Finish your work {#pr-finish-yours .step}

Congrats! Your pull request was merged!
That's awesome.
Now it's time to wrap things up by calling `pr_finish()`.

```{r pr_finish-yours, eval=FALSE}
pr_finish()
```
```
✓ Checking that remote branch 'origin/add-example' has the changes in 'add-example'
✓ Switching back to default branch ('main')
ℹ Pulling changes from 'origin/main'
✓ Deleting local 'add-example' branch
```

### Finish your work {#pr-finish-theirs .step}

Well done, 
your collaboration with `@wileycoyote` is complete and their PR is merged!
That's awesome.
Now it's time to wrap things up by calling `pr_finish()`.

```{r pr_finish-theirs, eval=FALSE}
pr_finish()
```
```
✔ Checking that remote branch 'wileycoyote/toone-model' has the changes in 'local/wileycoyote-toone-model'
✔ Switching back to 'main' branch
✔ Pulling changes from GitHub source repo 'origin/main'
✔ Deleting local 'wileycoyote-toone-model' branch
✔ Removing remote 'wileycoyote'
```

Notice that `pr_finish()` does quite a lot!
It makes sure that you don't accidentally leave behind
some changes in your local branch that might have forgotten to push.
Then it switches back to `main` and makes sure that's up to date, too.
Finally we forget all about `@wileycote`'s branch and forked repo.

### Clean up now that the PR has been merged {#pr-finish-number .step}

You don't have to be in your local copy of the PR branch
if you know the PR number.
Give the number to `pr_finish()`
and it will do the rest for you:
it moves back to the default branch,
updates your local copy,
and deletes the old PR branch.

```{r pr_finish-number, eval=FALSE}
pr_finish(11)
```
```
✓ Checking that remote branch 'origin/add-example' has the changes in 'add-example'
✓ Switching back to default branch ('main')
ℹ Pulling changes from 'origin/main'
✓ Deleting local 'add-example' branch
```

### Forget about your work {#pr-forget-yours .step}

Well that was fun.
But now you're done with this branch
and you call `pr_forget()` to delete it from your local copy.

```{r pr-forget, eval=FALSE}
pr_forget()
```
```
Local branch 'add-example' has no associated remote branch.
If we delete 'add-example', any work that exists only on this branch work may be hard for you to recover.
Proceed anyway?

1: No way
2: Not now
3: Yes

Selection: 3
✓ Switching back to default branch ('main')
✓ Pulling changes from 'origin/main'
✓ Deleting local 'add-example' branch
```

Notice that `pr_forget()` warns you about any work you might lose
and gives you a chance to rethink it.

### Forget about their work {#pr-forget-theirs .step}

Your work here is done and you'd like to move on with your life.
`pr_forget()` lets you put this branch behind you.
And while it's in there,
it also cleans up your repo,
deleting the local copy of the PR branch
and removing the PR author's repo fork
from the list of remote repositories your git project could sync with.

```{r pr_forget-theirs, eval=FALSE}
pr_forget()
```
```
✓ Switching back to default branch ('main')
✓ Pulling changes from 'origin/main'
✓ Deleting local 'wileycoyote-toone-models' branch
✓ Removing remote 'wileycoyote'
```

That was smooth!
Notice that `pr_forget()` moved you into the default branch of your repo,
`main`,
and it even made sure that branch is up to date.

`pr_forget()` is safe and cautious.
If your local `wileycoyote-toone-models` branch 
had had any changes in it that you might have lost,
`pr_forget()` would have warned you.
You also know that you can get back to the PR branch any time
using `pr_fetch()`.
