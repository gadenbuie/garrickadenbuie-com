<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <span class="pkg"><a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org">usethis</a></span> package is full of incredibly helpful functions
that make life as an R developer easier.
A lot of the package’s functions target R package maintainers,
but there’s a small cluster of functions that are life changing
for anyone who uses <code>git</code> or collaborates with others via GitHub<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These pull request helpers all start with the <code>pr_</code> prefix,
but I initially found them a little confusing to use
since they’re each designed to be called in a specific context —
for example, when you have local work that isn’t associated with a PR
or when a PR exists but you don’t have the work locally on your computer.</p>
<p>Once I wrapped my head around the functions, though,
using them has utterly transformed my day-to-day workflow.
I can move in and out of collaborative work seamlessly.
The flow chart above is my personal mental model of this cluster of functions
and I hope it helps you make sense of them, too.</p>
<p>There are other great resources available in the <span class="pkg">usethis</span> documentation.
Beyond the <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/pull-requests.html">function documentation</a>,
there’s also the great <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/pr-functions.html"><em>Pull request helpers</em> article</a>.
That article walks through a pull request
from the perspective of a contributor
and a package maintainer.</p>
<p>In this blog post, however,
you get to play both roles and choose your own adventure!</p>

<div id="intro" class="section level2">
<h2>Choose your own pull request adventure</h2>
<p>Welcome to this choose-your-own-adventure blog post.
<span id="instructions">You don’t need to read this one from top to bottom.
Instead, jumping around is encouraged!</span></p>
<p>Look for the <i class="fas fa-map-signs" aria-hidden="true" title="Decision Time"></i><span class="sr-only">Decision time:</span> icon.
It tells you that it’s time for you make a choice.
But don’t worry, there’s no wrong choice:
if you take a wrong turn
you can always use your browser’s <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-left" aria-hidden="true" title="Back"></i><span class="sr-only">back</span> button
to retrace your steps.</p>

<div id="get-started" class="section level3 step">
<h3>Let’s get started</h3>
<p>You open your project in RStudio (or the editor of your choice).
You make a note to yourself to come up with a better name for your package —
for now you’re calling it <span class="pkg">acme</span>
because it’s mostly a collection of random functions you’ve written.</p>
<p>Anyway, you’re thankful that you closed all of your open files the last time you were working,
but now the empty console beckons.
You’re ready to do some work.</p>
<p>Where do you begin? With <span class="pkg"><a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org">usethis</a></span> of course.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(usethis)</code></pre>

<div id="pr-init" class="section level3 step">
<h3>Start new work</h3>
<p>Time to start something new.
You scan your project board, issues list, JIRA tickets, slack messages, emails, and post-it notes
and finally settle on something to work on.
Your task: add an example to the documentation for a function you’ve been working on.</p>
<p>You want to start your work in a new branch,
so you call <code>pr_init()</code>,
giving it the name of your new branch.</p>

<h3>Choose a branch and resume working</h3>
<p>Don’t worry, <span class="pkg">usethis</span> has your back.
Just run <code>pr_resume()</code> without any arguments

<code>pr_resume()</code> helpfully sorts the branches by recency of work
and tells you if any of the branches are related to pull requests.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pr_resume()</code></pre>

<p>We picked option <code>1</code> to keep working in our <code>add-example</code> branch.

<p>Look at you, smarty pants.
You remember your git branch names!
I’m proud of you.</p>
<p>Good news,
<code>pr_resume()</code> can switch to the <code>"add-example"</code> branch for you
and it also makes sure that your local copy is up-to-date!</p>

<div id="pr-fetch-review" class="section level3 step">
<h3>Review or collaborate with someone else’s work</h3>
<p>Version control software like git
and collaborative coding platforms like GitHub
are plenty of fun when you’re working on your own.
But they really start to shine when you use them to collaborate with others.</p>
<p>The same is true for the <span class="pkg">usethis</span> PR helper functions.
Setting up your local repo to pull down the changes from a collaborator –
changes that probably live in a branch in <em>their copy</em> of the repo –
can be a frustrating experience full of online searching
to remember the specific incantations required
to get your collaborators onto your computer and open in front of you.</p>
<p>But have no fear,
<code>pr_fetch()</code> does all of this for you,
in just one command in your R console.</p>
<div class="decision">
<p><i class="way-point fas fa-map-signs" aria-hidden="true" title="Decision Time"></i><span class="sr-only">Decision time:</span> Do you know the pull request number?</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pr-fetch" class="section level3 step">
<h3>Open a remote branch, locally</h3>
<p>The pull request is open on GitHub
and you can see the changes there,
but you just can’t interact with the code in the same way through the browser.
You have to bring that code into your local IDE
where you can hold it in your hand
and poke it with debuggers.</p>
<div class="decision">

<h3>Choose a PR and bring the changes onto your computer</h3>
<p>Your friend,
who affectionately calls themselves <code>@wileycoyote</code> on GitHub,
helpfully contributed a new function
to your bag of tricks package, <span class="pkg">acme</span>.
They sent you a message on Slack letting you know they submitted a PR,
but they didn’t mention the PR number.</p>
<p>No big deal —
you can call <code>pr_fetch()</code> from your local repository
without any arguments
and <code>pr_fetch()</code> will look up any open pull requests
and give you the option to pick the one you want.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pr_fetch()</code></pre>

✓ Creating and switching to local branch &#39;wileycoyote-toone-model&#39;
✓ Setting &#39;wileycoyote/toone-model&#39; as remote tracking branch</code></pre>
<p>You find your friend’s PR in the list and choose selection <code>2</code>.
Next time you can perform the same steps by providing the PR number —
<code>pr_fetch(14)</code> —
or you can use the menu again.
Who has time or brain space to memorize pull request numbers?</p>
<p>Now that you have the code from the PR available to you locally,
you’re free to poke around to try out the code and review it.</p>

<h3>Open a PR locally</h3>
<p>You’ve been working with your friend,

on a new set of model tuning functions.
They’ve helpfully started working on a PR,

with them over the past few days,
you actually remember the pull request number.

<p>You already have a copy of the PR branch in your local project,
so <code>pr_fetch()</code> simply switched you into
the <code>wileycoyote-toone-model</code> branch
that it created when you first fetched the PR.</p>
<p>Because you might have been doing some work here before,
<code>pr_fetch()</code> does not try to update your local branch.

<p>Usually two people can work in the same project on two different areas

but when both you and someone else want to change the same lines of code,
you run into this issue.</p>
<p>Helpfully,
<code>pr_merge_main()</code> can get the latest changes from the main branch of your project

<pre class="r"><code>pr_merge_main()</code></pre>
<pre><code>✓ Pulling changes from &#39;origin/main&#39; (default branch of source repo)

To back out of this merge, run `gert::git_merge_abort()` (in R) or `git merge --abort` (in the shell).</code></pre>
<p>If you need to fix any merge conflicts,
<code>pr_merge_main()</code> will alert you
that there are conflicts that need to be addressed.
It also opens the files for you if you want it to,

you’ve been doing some work in other areas of the package.
Since that other work has been added to the <code>main</code> branch,

<p>To do this, run <code>pr_merge_main()</code>.

<p>Sometimes the best thing you can do to solve a problem is give it some time.
Go for a walk, read something engaging, talk to a friend, take a shower.</p>
<p>And now you’re back with fresh eyes, more energy, and a full cup of coffee.
This time, things go better!
You fall easily into a flow and start writing some code.
As you go,
you periodically pause to stage files with <code>gert::git_add()</code>
or to commit batches of changes with <code>gert::git_commit()</code>.</p>
<p>After a bit you surprise yourself when you realize
that the thing you couldn’t figure out when you were tired yesterday

<h3>Collaborate with someone else</h3>
<p>This is exciting!
Your friend —
which feels like a totally natural way to describe <code>@wileycoyote</code>,
a person you know primarily from Twitter —
had a pretty cool idea
and you’re feeling the buzz of inspiration.
Even though they started the pull request,
you’re about to riff on the ideas they started laying down.</p>
<p>You pick out your <a href="https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/rsthemes/">favorite RStudio theme</a>
and turn up your favorite dance-slash-coding-slash-singing-out-loud music.</p>
<p>As you work,
you pause occasionally to stage files with <code>gert::git_add()</code>
and to commit them with <code>gert::git_commit()</code>.
Since you’re working with someone else,
you remember to
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1296/">write good commit messages</a>,
but since you’re having fun you also use
<a href="https://gitmoji.dev/">gitmoji to give each commit a good emoji.</a></p>

</div>

<div id="git-commit" class="section level3 step">
<h3>Take a snapshot of your work</h3>
<p><em>If you like it then you shoulda made a <code>git commit</code>.</em></p>
<p>There are two parts to taking a snapshot of your code.
And really,
it’s less like taking a picture and more like sending yourself an email
with a copy of your files.</p>
<p>First, you’ll pick the files that you want to add to the snapshot (or commit).
You can do this in the R console using <code>git_add()</code> from the <span class="pkg"><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/">gert</a></span> package.
Give the function a vector with the paths to the files you changed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gert::git_add(c(&quot;R/atom_arranger.R&quot;, &quot;man/atom_arranger.Rd&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>In git-speak,
<code>git_add()</code> adds the changes in the listed files to a staging area.
Running this command is like dragging a file into the email you’re writing.
We haven’t officially sent that email yet,
but we have a copy ready to go.
By the way,
you can still make more changes to the file
knowing that there’s a temporary copy in that email draft
in case anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>Then, once all the files you want to commit have been added,
you <em>commit</em> the changes.
In our email metaphor,
committing is a lot like pressing send on the email.</p>
<p>And just like an email,
the commit includes a message
where you can describe the updates you made to the files in the email (commit).</p>
<p>For this step you can use
<code>git_commit()</code>
(also from the <span class="pkg"><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/">gert</a></span> package)
which takes the commit message as a parameter.
Think of this message like the subject of an email to your future self.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gert::git_commit(&quot;Add an example to ?atom_arranger()&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><em>P.S. You can do this adding-and-committing dance in the <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html">Git pane in RStudio</a>, too.</em></p>
