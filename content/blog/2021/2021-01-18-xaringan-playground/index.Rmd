## xaringan is a gateway to CSS

Over the last few years, I've built many presentations with [[xaringan]]{.pkg}.
There are a lot of things to love about [xaringan]{.pkg},
but one thing I've noticed is that [xaringan]{.pkg} presentations
can be a gateway into the world of web development.

If you've worked with [R Markdown][rmarkdown] to create a report or blog or website to share online, 
you've probably encountered a few stylistic things you've wanted to change.
These changes tend to be small, 
like choosing a new font family or changing the color of links.
If you don't like the look of your report, 
there are [lots of themes to choose from](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)
in [rmarkdown]{.pkg}, or in other packages like 
[prettydocs](https://prettydoc.statr.me/),
[rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats),
or [cleanrmd](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/cleanrmd/).

[xaringan]{.pkg} is a little different.
Slides are a visual medium.
You probably have an idea of how you want your slides to look as you work on them.

You can get really far with plain markdown using the few little extras that [xaringan]{.pkg} provides,
but at a certain point in the process of transferring your vision of your talk to the screen,
you've probably said,
out loud and not without a slight hint of frustration:
_I just want that thing to go right **there**_.

This is why I love [xaringan]{.pkg}.
Each slide is a small, self-contained web design project.
The constraints are well-defined: you can't build an _entire website_.
You don't have to make an app or think about a user interface.
You just need to make _this slide_ look great.

In point-and-click software, this is where you'd spend some time dragging text and images around or digging through menus to make your slides look awesome.
In [xaringan]{.pkg}, your slides are web page,
so we instead need to turn to CSS to style our slides.
I'm not going to say that one method is necessarily better than the other,
just that I personally love writing code and I actually enjoy CSS.
I might be weird in that respect,
but since you're still reading this I'm guessing you are too.

There are two advantages of using [xaringan]{.pkg} and CSS for our slides that I think are important.
First, knowing CSS is useful in more places than just making slides.
Many of the things I've designed for a presentation
have been useful in other areas of my life as an R Markdown user and person who puts things on the internet for others to enjoy.

Second, while CSS can be daunting to learn, with [xaringan]{.pkg} you don't need to know it all.
You only need to worry about the boxes inside the empty box of your slides,
without having to think about laying out an entire web page.
Plus, while you might share your slides online for others to see,
as long as they look good when you present them, then your job was well done.

This is why I see [xaringan]{.pkg} as a playground for trying new things.
It sets you up to play with CSS, to learn something new, and to get quick, immediate feedback.
Plus, it feels good to make things that look great and to share them with the world!

Not only that, [xaringan]{.pkg} has a few tricks up its sleeve.
