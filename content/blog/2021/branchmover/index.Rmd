Introducing [branchMover], a [Shiny] app slash [RStudio] addin for coordinated default branch changes across your [GitHub] repositories.

The app show you the default branch name for all of your repos and coordinates changing the default branch, including creating an issue to communicate the change.

:::

## Moving to `main` street

Over the past year, 
there's been a concerted effort among people who create and manage git repositories
to move away from the default branch name of `master`
to something more intentional: typically `main`.

[RStudio] and the [tidyverse] team recently undertook the giant challenge
of changing the default branch of RStudio's approximately 350 public repositories
(most of which are all open source!).

Watching [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/)'s superb stewardship of the change inspired a new app `branchMover`.
Admittedly, I didn't spend much time thinking about the name because the app won't be in your life for very long.

The goal of [branchMover] is to help you coordinate a default branch change across the repos you maintain.
The app shows you all of the repos associated with your GitHub account and their current default branch.
Because you might want to start with your less popular repos, you can sort by number of forks and stars on each repo.

There's also a button to change the default branch.
When you click the button, the app clones your repo and uses
the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org) package
and the recently added
[usethis::git_default_branch_rename()](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/git-default-branch.html)
function to update the default branch of your repo.

I followed Jenny's lead and the app will create an issue announcing the change.
If all goes well, 
the issue is closed a few seconds later
with instructions for your users on how to update any local copies of your repo.
If it doesn't go well, 
the issue stay open as a reminder to you to finish the process.

Unfortunately, branchMover *doesn’t* update the default branch in *your*
local copies of your repos. Thankfully, this is relatively pain-free
with the
[usethis::git_default_branch_rediscover()](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/git-default-branch.html)
function, added in [usethis]{.pkg} version 2.1.2.

The next time you find yourself in your local copy of your repo,
run `git_default_branch_rediscover()` to reconfigure your branch situation.

```r
git_default_branch_rediscover()
#> ℹ Default branch of the source repo 'jennybc/happy-git-with-r': 'main'
#> ✓ Default branch of local repo has moved: 'master' --> 'main'
```

## Installation

You can install [branchMover] from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/branchMover")
```

The app uses the [[usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org)]{.pkg} and
[[gh](https://gh.r-lib.org)]{.pkg} packages. You need to configure gh with a
[Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
to be able to authenticate with the GitHub API:
read more about [Managing Personal Access
Tokens](https://gh.r-lib.org/articles/managing-personal-access-tokens.html)
in the [gh]{.pkg} documentation.

Then, in RStudio, run the app with:

``` r
branchMover::app()
```

## Why change branches?

If you want to learn more about how git's default branch works
and why many are opting to choose a more intentional default,
I highly recommend Jenny's detailed article 
[Renaming the default branch](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/),
which I'll quote directly:

> Technically, Git has no official concept of the default branch. But in practice, most Git repos have an _effective default branch_. If there’s only one branch, this is it! It is the branch that most bug fixes and features get merged in to. It is the branch you see when you first visit a repo on a site such as GitHub. On a Git remote, it is the branch that `HEAD` points to. The default branch may not be precisely defined in Git itself, but most of us know it when we see it.
>
> Historically, `master` has been the most common name for the default branch, but `main` is an increasingly popular choice. There is coordinated change across the Git ecosystem that is making it easier for users to make this switch, for example:
