<p>RStudio’s many <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>
take some time to learn but can save tons of typing in the long run.
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/">RStudio addins</a>
extend RStudio’s interface with small apps and actions,
and you can
<a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts">assign customized keyboard shortcuts</a>
to trigger any addin you have installed quickly from the keyboard.</p>
<p>Installing an addin isn’t hard —
and if you’re looking for new addins,
Dean Attali’s <a href="https://github.com/daattali/addinslist">addinslist</a> is the place to go.
But addins are installed via R packages,
so if you want to create your own addin,
you’ll have to create a new R package to store your addin.
And if you have to create a new R package,
you’ll need to think of a name for your R package.
But naming is hard,
and all the good words starting with or involving
the letter R
are already taken.</p>
<p>What if all you want to do is run
a function from an installed package
or a short bit of R code that does something useful
and that makes your workflow just a little smoother?</p>
<p>What if you want that function to run
whenever you press
<kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>?</p>
<p>It seems like there should be an easier way to do this
than to create an R package.</p>
<p>(<em>Have I convinced you that you also have the same problem I do,
or am I the only one?</em>)</p>
<div id="introducing-shrtcts" class="section level2">
<h2>Introducing shrtcts</h2>
<p><span class="pkg"><a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/shrtcts">shrtcts</a></span> is a small package I’ve put together
with the goal of making it easier
to register and manage RStudio addins
without having to maintain an R package.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>First, <strong>install shrtcts</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;gadenbuie/shrtcts&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then, <strong>create a YAML file</strong> called <code>.shrtcts.yaml</code>
and store it in your home directory<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
or in a directory called <code>.config</code> in your home directory.</p>
<p>This YAML file holds your shortcuts as a YAML list.
Each item looks a lot like the
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/#registering-addins">addins.dcf</a>
file that is used to register addins in R packages.
The only difference is that the <code>Binding</code> entry
can be any arbitrary R function or code.</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>- Name: Say Something Nice
  Description: A demo of cool things
  Binding: praise::praise
  Interactive: true</code></pre>
<p>I’m calling this shortcut
<em>Say Something Nice</em>
and whenever it is triggered it calls
<code>praise()</code> from the
<span class="pkg"><a href="https://github.com/rladies/praise">praise</a></span> package.</p>
<p>To <strong>install your shortcut</strong>,
run <code>add_rstudio_addin()</code> from <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span>
and restart your R session.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shrtcts::add_rstudio_shortcuts()
rstudioapi::restartSession()</code></pre>
<p>You can restart your R session by clicking <em>Session</em> &gt; <em>Restart R</em>.
Now you should now be able to find
the <em>Say Something Nice</em> addin in your addins list!</p>

<h3>Shortcut, meet keyboard</h3>
<div id="assigning-keyboard-shortcuts-to-your-addin-shortcuts" class="section level4">
<h4>Assigning keyboard shortcuts to your addin shortcuts</h4>
<p>Once you’ve installed your shortcut addins,
you can then assign a keyboard shortcut to run your addin.
Select <em>Modify Keyboard Shortcuts…</em>
from the <em>Tools</em> menu</p>
<p><img alt="RStudio 'Modify Keyboard Shortcuts' item in the 'Tools' menu"

     width="360px"
     style="max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>and then search for your shortcut.
Click on the blank space in the <em>Shortcut</em> column
and press the keys that will be the your new shortcut.
Here, I’m assigning the <em>Say Something Nice</em> addin to
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.</p>

     width="800px"
     style="max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>After setting the shortcut,
I usually check to make sure my new keyboard shortcut
doesn’t collide with a previously installed shortcut
by clearing the search and sorting by the shortcut column.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-few-details-to-keep-in-mind-about-keyboard-shortcuts" class="section level4">
<h4>A few details to keep in mind about keyboard shortcuts</h4>
<p>There are a two things to keep in mind about using keyboard shortcuts
with your <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> shortcuts.</p>
<p>First, if you re-install or update <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span>,
your currently existing keyboard shortcuts should survive the transition.
Make sure that you run <code>add_rstudio_addins()</code> again after updating,
and make sure that you re-start your R session.</p>
<p>Second, the order of your shortcuts in your <code>.shrtcts.yaml</code> file matters,
unless you explicitly set the <code>id</code> entry to a number between 1 and 100.
This means that it’s a good idea to set the <code>id</code>
of shortcuts that you’re going to use with keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>- Name: Say Something Nice
  Description: A demo of cool things
  Binding: praise::praise
  id: 1
  Interactive: true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="adding-more-shortcuts" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding more shortcuts</h3>
<p>To add more shortcuts,
continue adding entries in your <code>.shrtcts.yaml</code> file.
If you don’t want to run <code>add_rstudio_shortcuts()</code>
every time you update your shortcuts,
you can add the following line in your <code>~/.Rprofile</code><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (interactive() &amp; requireNamespace(&quot;shrtcts&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) {
  shrtcts::add_rstudio_shortcuts()
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> comes with a demonstration <code>.shrtcts.yaml</code> file
that you can use for inspiration.
Print out the example YAML file contents with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shrtcts::example_shortcuts_yaml()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="shortcuts-can-be-arbitrary-r-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Shortcuts can be arbitrary R code</h3>
<p>Your shortcut doesn’t need to call a function in a package.
In fact,
you can create shortcuts that run R code
simply by putting the code you want to run in the <code>Binding</code> entry.</p>
<p>Here’s an example shortcut that picks a number between 0 and 100.
(Great for playing <em>what number of am I think of?</em>)</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>- Name: I&#39;m thinking of a number...
  Binding: sample(0:100, 1)</code></pre>
<p>Notice the binding is just R code
(I was thinking of 53, by the way),
and the only fields you <em>need</em> to include
are the <code>Name</code> and the <code>Binding</code>.</p>
<p>Your shortcuts don’t need to fit on a single line either.
You can use
<a href="https://yaml-multiline.info/">multi-line literal-style YAML blocks</a>
for your R code.
In other words, add <code>|</code> after <code>Binding</code> and then indent your R code.</p>
<p>Here’s an example shortcut that I use occasionally
to create a temporary markdown file
so that I can test some markdown or R code
and have the file be thrown away when I exit my R session.</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>- Name: New Temporary R Markdown Document
  Binding: |
    tmp &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.Rmd&quot;)
    rmarkdown::draft(
      tmp,
      template = &quot;github_document&quot;,
      package = &quot;rmarkdown&quot;,
      edit = FALSE
    )
    rstudioapi::navigateToFile(tmp)
  Interactive: false</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="behind-the-scenes" class="section level2">
<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>How does this all work?
<span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> comes with a minimal addins registry
with one addin that browses to the help page <code>?add_rstudio_addins</code>.</p>
<p>When you run <code>add_rstudio_addins()</code>,
<span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> rewrites it’s own addins registry
using your shortcut title and description.
It also assigns each shortcut in <code>.shrtcts.yaml</code>
to an id from 1 to 100,
which correspond to 100 shortcut functions
in the <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> package.
Each addin is wired to one of these functions,
so when you run the associated addin
<span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> looks up the correct shortcut in your
<code>.shrtcts.yaml</code> file and runs that shortcut.</p>
<p>This why you need to run <code>add_rstudio_addins()</code>
whenever you add or modify <em>the order</em> of your shortcuts.
Whenever this happens, <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> has to re-wire
the addins registry to make sure everything is connect.</p>
<p>This is also why you need to restart your R session
for the addins to be seen by RStudio.
RStudio only checks for package addins when R starts up,
so the R session restart triggers RStudio to refresh the addin registry.</p>
<div id="inspiration" class="section level3">
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p><span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> was inspired by <span class="pkg"><a href="https://github.com/yonicd/rsam">rsam</a></span>,
the <em>RStudio Addins Manager</em> by <a href="https://github.com/yonicd">@yonicd</a>.
There’s a lot that <span class="pkg">rsam</span> can do —
including helping you manage your keyboard shortcuts —
and <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> is essentially an extension of <span class="pkg">rsam</span>’s
<a href="https://github.com/yonicd/rsam#limited-liability-addins">limited liability addins</a>.
<span class="pkg">rsam</span> provides three slots for custom addins
that in turn look for specially-named functions defined in the global environment.
In the addins menu,
these three custom addins appear as
<strong>lla1</strong>, <strong>lla2</strong>, and <strong>lla3</strong>.
The upside of <span class="pkg">rsam</span>
is that you don’t have to write code in YAML (huge plus!),
but the downside is that the names of the addins are fixed.</p>
<p><span class="pkg">shrtcts</span>,
on the other hand,
rewrites its own addin registry so that you can have customized addin names and descriptions.
In both packages,
the number of custom addins is limited:
<span class="pkg">rsam</span> provides 3 slots,
while <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span> gives you 100.</p>

<div id="share-your-shortcuts" class="section level2">
<h2>Share Your Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Because <span class="pkg">shrtcts</span>
stores your shortcuts in stand-alone(-ish) YAML files,
you can share your shortcuts file with others (or yourself)
by posting it somewhere online,
for example as a <a href="https://gist.github.com">Github Gist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/gadenbuie/140204f122240f397e68e610643a4190">Here’s a small collection of shortcuts</a>
that I use and that inspired me to create this package
so that I didn’t have to think of another package name.</p>
<p>I hope <span class="pkg"><a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/shrtcts">shrtcts</a></span> is helpful to you!
