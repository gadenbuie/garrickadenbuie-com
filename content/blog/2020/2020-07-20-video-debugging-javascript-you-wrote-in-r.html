<div class="lead">
<p><span class="pkg"><a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org/">htmlwidgets</a></span> makes it easy to create awesome web things from R and R Markdown, but sometimes you have to write your own JavaScript code… in strings… in R. What do you do if it doesn’t work? How can you write JavaScript interactively?</p>

<p>I “live streamed” my process
as I worked through debugging
some buggy JavaScript that <a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_mock">Tom Mock</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_mock/status/1284932187352072192">shared on twitter</a>,
touching on the tools used
to debug JavaScript and
some features from the <span class="pkg"><a href="https://pkg.js4shiny.com">js4shiny</a></span> package
that help R users with web development.</p>
<p>The example uses the awesome <span class="pkg"><a href="https://glin.github.io/reactable">reactable</a></span> package,
which helps you make some incredible HTML interactive HTML tables.</p>
<p>If you want to try this at home,
I’ve uploaded the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/gadenbuie/9ce3a58a7f6109c23cdd68711a2623ae">code that doesn’t work</a>
and the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/gadenbuie/7d8bb61476dcfa4459fb6e8b7a219022">code that does work</a>
as GitHub gists.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way,
I’m using the RStudio theme “Flat White” from <span class="pkg"><a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes/">rsthemes</a></span>.</p>

<p>This is the first time I’ve made a video like this.
