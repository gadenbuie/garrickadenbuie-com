Showcase your presentations in style 
with great-looking social media cards
and responsive, seamlessly embedded slides in web pages.

You put a lot of time and effort into your slides:
structuring content,
choosing the right gifs,
tweaking colors and picking fonts.
In short: slidecrafting.

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
dir.create(here::here("static", "blog", "sharing-xaringan-slides"), showWarnings = FALSE)

tweetrmd::tweet_screenshot(
  tweet_url = "https://twitter.com/grrrck/status/1159087961931169795",
  file = here::here("static", "blog", "sharing-xaringan-slides", "tweet-slidecraft.png")
)

In this post,
I'll share some tips and strategies for publishing your [[xaringan]]{.pkg} slides online.
Here's a linked checklist with the steps I'll cover here.

## Checklist

```{css echo=FALSE}

  padding-left: 1em;
}
.checklist ul li {

  display: inline;
}
```

```{r info-icon, echo=FALSE}
info <- function(slug) {
  htmltools::withTags(
    a(
      href = paste0("#", slug),
      i(class = "fa fa-info-circle")
    )
  )
}
```

:::

## Fill in Metadata

The first step is to give your slides all the metadata required
to be found via search engines or to look great
when shared on social media sites.

To do this,
I recommend using a small package I wrote called [[metathis]]{.pkg}.
It's available on CRAN!

```{r install-metathis, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("metathis")
```

Basically,
[metathis]{.pkg} helps fill out `<meta>` tags in your HTML document.
These tags are used by 
search engines and 
social media sites like Twitter and Facebook
to describe your page, 
list the title and author,
link to your profile,
and show a preview image for the page
(we'll get to this in [the next section](#create-a-social-media-card)).

Here's a template you can use for your own slides.
I'm using a [recent presentation](/talk/build-your-own-universe/) as an example, 
or you can reference [the example in the metathis documentation][metathis-xaringan].

````markdown
```{r metathis, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
library(metathis)
meta() %>%
  meta_name("github-repo" = "gadenbuie/build-your-own-universe") %>% 
  meta_social(
    title = "Build your own universe",
    description = paste(
      "Scale high-quality research data provisioning with R packages.",
      "Presented at R/Medicine 2020."
    ),
    url = "https://build-your-own-universe.netlify.app",
    image = "https://build-your-own-universe.netlify.app/social-card.png",
    image_alt = paste(
      "Title slide of Build your own universe:", 
      "Scale high-quality research data provisioning with R packages,", 
      "presented at R/Medicine 2020 by Travis Gerke and Garrick Aden-Buie"
    ),
    og_type = "website",
    og_author = "Travis Gerke",
    twitter_card_type = "summary_large_image",
    twitter_creator = "@grrrck",
    twitter_site = "@travisgerke"
  )
```
````

Most of the arguments are self-explanatory or well-described in `?meta_social`.
One thing to watch out for is that the `image`
argument must be the full-qualified URL to the image.
In other words, the entire URL including the `https://` bit,
taking into account where the slides will live when you [put them online](#get-your-slides-online).

## Create a Social Media Card

### Why should you add a preview image?

```{r slide-preview-tweets, eval=FALSE}
tweetrmd::tweet_screenshot(
  tweet_url = "https://twitter.com/i_steves/status/1086028069519933440",
  file = here::here("static", "blog", "sharing-xaringan-slides", "tweet-slides-shared-image.png")
)

tweetrmd::tweet_screenshot(
  tweet_url = "https://twitter.com/revodavid/status/471320054874009600",
  file = here::here("static", "blog", "sharing-xaringan-slides", "tweet-slides-no-preview.png")
)

tweetrmd::tweet_screenshot(
  tweet_url = "https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1096461439609511936",
  file = here::here("static", "blog", "sharing-xaringan-slides", "tweet-slides-share-card.png")
)
```

Social media cards are the rich link previews 
you see on websites like Twitter and Facebook.
I think it's worth the extra work
to include a preview image for several reasons.

First, it's much more likely that your link will be seen,
especially if your preview image is interesting or visually compelling.
Users are more likely 
to click through and take a look at your slides
when they have some idea of what's on the other side of the link.

Second, 
the preview image is a tiny window into your own personal style.
You have no control over 
the rest of the time line where your link is being shared —
your 280 characters look just like everyone else's —
but your preview image is __your space__
to visually communicate your personal style.


And finally, using a preview image means that your crafted message
will appear every time your link is shared,
not just the first time.
A common alternative is to share the link to the slides,
but to add an image to share post.
This looks great _the first time_ the link is shared,
but when someone else shares your slides' link,
they probably won't go to the trouble of including a screenshot.

Here are three examples of tweets sharing slides
that illustrate the various approaches to link previews.

```{css echo=FALSE}
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
.grid-col-3 {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
.grid-col-2 {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}
.grid p.caption {
	text-align: center;
	padding-left: 1.5em;
	padding-right: 1.5em;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {
  .grid-col-3, .grid-col-2 {
    max-width: 300px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(1, auto);
  }
  .grid p.caption {
    padding: 0;
    text-align: right;
  }
}
```

::::: {.grid .grid-col-3}

::: tweet
```{r tweet-slides-no-preview, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
lightbox_img(
  "tweet-slides-no-preview.png", 
  alt = "Tweet from @revodavid sharing a link to slides. The slides' link has limited metadata and only text is shown in the link preview.",
  caption = "Slide link with limited metadata.  (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/revodavid/status/471320054874009600\">tweet</a>)"
)
```
:::

```{r tweet-slides-shared-image, results="asis", echo=FALSE}

  alt = "Tweet from @i_steves sharing a link to slides, with a screenshot of the first slide shared as an image attached to the tweet.",
  caption = "Slide link with a shared image. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i_steves/status/1086028069519933440\">tweet</a>)"
)
```

lightbox_img(
  "tweet-slides-share-card.png", 
  alt = "Tweet from @hadleywickham sharing a link to slides, with complete metadata. The preview image from the link shows the first slide.",
  caption = "Slide link with a preview image and complete metadata.  (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1096461439609511936\">tweet</a>)"
)
```

### Taking a screenshot of your slides

How do you create an image for your social media cards?
I'm glad you asked!
Typically, I like to take a screenshot of the title slide
and use that as the preview image.

Taking a screenshot of your slides is incredibly easy
if you're using [Firefox](https://firefox.com),
which has a [built-in screenshot feature](https://screenshots.firefox.com/).
On Chrome, you can install an extension, like [Nimbus Capture](https://nimbusweb.me/screenshot.php).

To take a screenshot, I open my slides in Firefox
and select _Take a Screenshot_ from the three-dots menu in the browser URL bar.

![Firefox's **Take a Screenshot** menu option](screenshot-firefox-step1.png)

Then, don't click "Save full page" or "Save visible".
Instead, click on your slides area so the entire slide is selected
and then click "Download".

::::: {.grid .grid-col-2}

::: firefox-screenshot
```{r screenshot-firefox-2, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
lightbox_img(
  "screenshot-firefox-step2.png",
  alt = "Firefox's screenshot feature, step 2. The user needs to click on the slides area to select the entire slide.",
  caption = "Click on the slides area to select the entire slide."
)
```
:::

::: firefox-screenshot
```{r screenshot-firefox-3, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
lightbox_img(
  "screenshot-firefox-step3.png",
  alt = "Firefox's screenshot feature, step 3. The user needs to select 'Download' to save the image.",
  caption = "Download the screenshot to save the file into your Downloads folder."
)
```

### The perfect share image ratio

If you're using 
a `4:3` (the [xaringan]{.pkg} default)
or `16:9` (my personal favorite)
slide ratio,
chances are that your share image will look okay...
but not _perfect_.
In particular,
if you're targeting Twitter
(for sharing with [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)),
you might find that parts of your preview image
are cut off if the image width and height aren't _just right_.

It turns out that 
[the best ratio for share card images](https://marketing.twitter.com/na/en/solutions/ad-format-specs/website-card.html)
on Twitter 
is `1.91:1`.

So to get the best image possible,
you'll need to temporarily render your slides with this aspect ratio
by changing the `ratio` to `191:100` in your slides' YAML header.
(It turns out that [remarkjs](https://remarkjs.com)
doesn't like fractional ratio units, hence the need to multiply by 100.)

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    # ... other xaringan options ...
    nature:
      ratio: 191:100
```


Set the YAML header,
render your slides,
open in a browser,
and [take a screenshot](#taking-a-screenshot-of-your-slides).

If this sounds like a hassle, it's because it kind of is.
Fortunately,
we can use the [[webshot2](https://github.com/rstudio/webshot2)]{.pkg} package
to automate the entire process.
Note [webshot2]{.pkg} requires that you have Chrome installed on your computer
and is only available from GitHub.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/webshot2")
```

Then, you can use this little function below
to render your `slides_rmd` in the funky ratio needed for the share image,
saving a screenshot of the first slide to `path`.

```{r screenshot-share-image, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#' Screenshot Your Title Slide for Share Image
#'
#' Takes a screenshot of your title slide for sharing on Twitter
#' (and other social media sites).
#'
#' @param slides_rmd Your slides file
#' @param path Path to new share image
screenshot_share_image <- function(
  slides_rmd,
  path_image = "share-card.png"
) {
  if (!requireNamespace("webshot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
    stop(
      "`webshot2` is required: ", 
      'remotes::install_github("rstudio/webshot2")'
    )
  }
  
  webshot2::rmdshot(
    doc = slides_rmd,
    file = path_image,
    vheight = 600,
    vwidth = 600 * 191 / 100,
    rmd_args = list(
      output_options = list(
        nature = list(ratio = "191:100"),
        self_contained = TRUE
      )
    )
  )
  
  path
}
```

To use the function, just give it the path to your slides `.Rmd`
and `share-card.png` will be created in your working directory.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
screenshot_share_image("my_slides.Rmd")
```

## Add a "share bar"

You're almost done prepping your slides for sharing!
If you know that you'll embed your slides
on your website or someone else's page,
you'll want to add a **share bar** to your slides
using [`use_share_again()`](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/share-again)
from [xaringanExtra]{.pkg}.

````markdown
```{r xaringanExtra-share-again, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
xaringanExtra::use_share_again()
```
````

![Meet **share again** from [xaringanExtra]{.pkg}](meet-share-again.jpg)

The **share again** extension adds a small bar at the bottom of your slides — 
but only when the slides are embedded in an `<iframe>`.
The bar contains buttons to move between slides,
which often isn't obvious when you're looking at embedded slides.
It also makes it easy to go full screen
and there's a sharing menu for quickly sharing your slides on social media sites.

It turns out that the **Viewer** pane in RStudio is also an `<iframe>`,
so the share bar will show up when you preview your slides in RStudio,
but it won't appear if you load your slides directly in a browser window.

Check out the [full _share again_ documentation for more information](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/share-again).

## Get Your Slides Online

Now that your slides are all set up and ready to be shared (or presented!),
you need to get your slides online!
For tips on how to best get your slides online,
I'll defer to the excellent presentation,
[Sharing on Short Notice](https://rstudio-education.github.io/sharing-short-notice/),
by Alison Hill and Desirée De Leon.

```{r sharing-on-short-notice}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan("https://rstudio-education.github.io/sharing-short-notice/")
```

Those slides are also available at the short link [rstd.io/sharing](https://rstd.io/sharing).

## Pre-Flight Checks

Now that your slides are online,
it's time to check that they look as good as you expect
before you share them with the world.

To **check your metadata**,
you can use Twitter's [share card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator).
Drop in your link and Twitter will show you a preview of the share card for your link.
Much better than sending yourself private messages to find out how your share card looks!

Similarly, you can also test your [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) tags
(used by Facebook and other sites)
with [opengraphcheck.com](https://opengraphcheck.com) or
on Facebook's [Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/).

Finally,
it's a good idea to open your slides in every browser you have on your machine
— or at the very least in just one browser —
and walk through your slides to make sure everything works 
and that you haven't forgotten to upload any images or assets.

## Embed Your Slides

Now that your slides are out in the world,
you might want to embed them in your web page,
for example in a [talk page](/talks/build-your-own-universe)
or the [talks](/talks) section of your website.

To do this, I recommend using `embed_xaringan()` from [xaringanExtra]{.pkg}.
It embeds your slides in a responsive, aspect-ratio `<iframe>`,
meaning that the slides are seamlessly embedded in the page
and their size is automatically adjusted to maintain the aspect ratio
that matches your slides.

Here's an example of embedded slides from a recent talk I gave with [Travis Gerke](https://travisgerke.com).

```{r embed-example, echo=TRUE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://build-your-own-universe.netlify.app",
  ratio = "16:9"
)
```

Notice that if you've used [share again](#add-a-share-bar),
your embedded slides will have a nice share bar for navigation and sharing.
  
## Share with the World!

You're finally ready!
Good luck with your presentation
and don't forget to tweet out your awesome slides when you're done
(or right before you start!).
