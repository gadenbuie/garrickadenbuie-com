<p>You receive an excessively hot cup of coffee at your local coffee shop.
As it’s the first cup of the day, your main objective is to consume the caffeine as quickly as possible.
Unfortunately, if you were to gulp down the coffee the barista just handed you now, you would most certainly end up taking a trip to the hospital for second-degree burns.</p>
<p>Fortunately you have at your disposal a caraffe of properly chilled cream and a dreamy appreciation for dynamic systems.
The question is: to reach your ideal coffee-consumption temperature as quickly as possible, should you mix the cream immediately into the coffee or should you wait a certain amount of time?</p>
<p>Assuming you have (groggily) estimated the following variables:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Variable</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(T_{Cof}\)</span></td>
<td>Temperature of the coffee</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(T_{D}\)</span></td>
<td>Desired temperature for the coffee</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(T_{R}\)</span></td>
<td>Temperature of the room</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(T_{Cr}\)</span></td>
<td>Temperature of the cream</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></td>
<td>Cooling rate coefficient</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(r\)</span></td>
<td>Percentage of coffee in final mixture</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_law_of_cooling">Newton’s law of cooling</a> to get started:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\dot{T}(t) = -k (T(t) - T_R)\]</span></p>
<p>This tells you that the change in surface temperature of an object is proportional to difference between the object’s temperature and the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>From this you know that the temperature of the coffee at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is given by the following solution to the above differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T(t) = T_R + \left(T_0 - T_R \right)e^{-kt}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> represents the initial temperature of an object and <span class="math inline">\(T_R\)</span> the temperature of the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Two strategies come to mind: immediately add the cream to the coffee, or wait until adding the cream will reduce the temperature just enough to achieve the desired temperature. But which will bring you your caffeine fix fastest?
<!-- more --></p>
<p>We’ll make the simplifying assumption that the mixing process is instantaneous and that the temperature of the final mixture is a weighted average of the temperatures of the two liquids, relative to their volume. We’ll further simplify this step by expressing our result in terms of the percentage of coffee in the final mixture, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Interactive R Shiny App</h4>
<p>I made an interactive plot where you can dynamically alter (play with) the problem parameters using <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">RStudio’s Shiny App</a>. If you have R 3.x and Shiny installed, you can run the app by simply calling <code>runGist(9370271)</code> after loading Shiny.

<h3>Mix immediately</h3>
<p>If the cream is added immediately, then the effective initial temperature of the coffee is <span class="math inline">\(rT_{Cof}+(1-r)T_{Cr}\)</span> and this mixture will reach the desired temperature in time <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> units:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_D = T_R + \left(rT_{Cof}+(1-r)T_{Cr} - T_R \right)e^{-k\tau_1}\]</span></p>

</div>
<div id="wait-the-right-amount-of-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Wait the right amount of time</h3>
<p>If instead the cream is added at just the right time so that, when the coffee is combined with the cream, the resultant mixture will have the desired temperature, then the time at which the cream should be added (and also the time at which <span class="math inline">\(T_D\)</span> is achieved) is <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span>, given as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_D = \left[ T_R + \left( T_{Cof} - T_R \right) e^{-k\tau_2} \right] r + (1-r)T_{Cr}\]</span></p>

<div id="comparing-tau_1-and-tau_2" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span></h3>
<p>The right hand side of the above equations are equivalent, so the question becomes which is smaller, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span>? Solving for the waiting time of each yields the following equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tau_1 &amp;= - \frac 1 k \ln \left[ \frac{T_D - T_R}{rT_{Cof} +(1-r)T_{Cr} - T_R} \right] \\\
&amp; \\\
\tau_2 &amp;= -\frac 1 k \ln \left[ \frac{T_D - (1-r)T_{Cr} - rT_R}{rT_{Cof} - rT_R} \right]\\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Because the question is which waiting time is shorter and <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x) \to - \infty\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(x \to 0\)</span>, the question then becomes which fraction inside the <span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span> functions is smaller. In this, we will assume that, given the physical characteristics of the problem, <span class="math inline">\(T_{Cr} &lt; T_R &lt; T_D &lt; T_{Cof}\)</span>, and that <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq r \leq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>To give away the punchline a little, what we’ll find is that by using the simple assumptions above we can show that the numerator in the <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> expression is smaller than the numerator in the <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span> expression, and that the denominator in <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> is bigger than the denominator in <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span>. If this is true, then clearly <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1 &gt; \tau_2\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(- \ln \left( \frac{-}{+} \right) &lt; - \ln \left( \frac{+}{-} \right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s first consider the numerators. <span class="math inline">\(T_D\)</span> is the same in both, so we need to compare the amount subtracted from it: <span class="math inline">\(T_R\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\((1-r)T_{Cr} + rT_rR\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that because <span class="math inline">\(T_{Cr} &lt; T_R\)</span>
<span class="math display">\[T_R = (1-r)T_R + rT_R &gt; (1-r)T_{Cr} + rT_R\]</span>
and thus <span class="math inline">\(T_D - T_R &lt; T_D - (1-r)T_{Cr} - rT_R\)</span>, indicating that the numerator in the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> is less than that of the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, consider the denominators, specifically the amount subtracted from <span class="math inline">\(rT_{Cof}\)</span> in both: <span class="math inline">\(T_R - (1-r)T_{Cr}\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(rT_R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here notice that <span class="math inline">\(rT_R = T_R - (1-r)T_R\)</span>. Then, from <span class="math inline">\(T_{Cr} &lt; T_R\)</span> we can conclude that <span class="math inline">\((1-r)T_{Cr} &lt; (1-r)T_R\)</span>, which further implies that <span class="math inline">\(T_R - (1-r)T_{Cr} &gt; T_R - (1-r) T_R = rT_R\)</span>. Thus the denominator in the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> is greater than the denominator in the expression of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
T_D - T_R &amp;&lt; T_D - (1-r)T_{Cr} - rT_R \\\
&amp; \\\
rT_{Cof} +(1-r)T_{Cr} - T_R &amp;&gt; rT_{Cof} - rT_R \\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>From this we can finally conclude that the fraction in the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> has a smaller numerator and larger denominator than that of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span>. The interpretation of this result is that waiting until <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span> to allows the coffee to reach the desired temperature faster than adding the cream immediately. The reduction in waiting time is a function of initial conditions and depends on the temperature differential, in particular between the cream and the room and coffee.</p>
<p>So, if you need faster caffeine intake: wait a bit before adding your cold cream (or almond milk).
On the flip side, if you want to keep your coffee hotter for longer, add your cream right away.
Or get a real coffee habit and skip the cream entirely<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
