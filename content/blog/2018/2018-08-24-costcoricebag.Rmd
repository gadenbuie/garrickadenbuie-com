I found this tweet today and I was intrigued.

`r blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1032699857117605888")`

What exactly had this person pulled off?
What was this all-caps GREATEST TWITTER SCHEME OF ALL TIME?

I wanted to know.
But I didn't want to scroll through endless tweets.
[Jump ahead to the answer](#final-result) if you're in a hurry yourself.

To figure out what exactly was going on on Twitter, I turned to my favorite Twitter-related package: [rtweet].
Getting all of [&commat;CostcoRiceBag](https://twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag)'s recent tweets was suprisingly simple — all it takes is a single call to [`get_timeline()`](https://rtweet.info/reference/get_timeline.html):

```{r get-timeline, eval=FALSE}
library(rtweet)
library(dplyr)

crb_tweets <- get_timeline("costcoricebag", n = 3200)
```

```{r get-timeline-cache, include=FALSE}
library(rtweet)
library(dplyr)

crb_tweet <- readRDS(here::here("_data/tweets_costcoricebag.rds"))
```

From here, I simply filtered out replies and straight-up retweets (but not quote tweets), and then extracted the first word in the tweet text using a little [regex](/project/regexplain/).
Upon arranging the tweets in reverse chronological order, the pattern in the `first_word` column is immediately apparent.

```{r first-words}
first_words <- crb_tweets %>% 
  filter(
    !is_retweet, 
    is.na(reply_to_status_id),
    created_at <= lubridate::ymd_hms("2018-08-23 18:43:27"),
    created_at >= lubridate::ymd_h("2018-05-07 15"),
    !grepl("^@", text)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    first_word = sub("^\\W*([\\w'’]+)[\\S\\s]+", "\\1", text, perl = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(created_at))

first_words %>% 
  select(created_at, text, first_word) 
```

## Queen of the First Word Tweets {#final-result}

The final result is amazing and definitely pretty much the greatest Twitter scheme ever.
Hover over each word to see the text of the full tweet, or click on the word to go to the tweet.

<blockquote>
```{r result, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
first_words %>% 
  mutate(
    text = gsub("'", "’", text), # Fix issue with single quote
    text = gsub("\"", "&quot;", text)
  ) %>% 
  glue::glue_data('<a title="{text}" style="color: #606060;" href="{status_url}">{first_word}</a>') %>% 
  glue::glue_collapse(sep = " ") %>% 
  cat()
```
</blockquote>

In total, writing out the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody in reverse order took
**`r nrow(first_words)`** tweets over
**`r as.integer(difftime(max(first_words$created_at), min(first_words$created_at), "day"))`** days.

When did [&commat;CostcoRiceBag](https://twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag) do most of their Queen-related tweeting?
To get an idea of how often they tweeted, I created a calendar heatmap (or GitHub-style square tile plot) of their daily tweeting activities.

```{r tileplot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
library(ggplot2)
first_words %>%
  mutate(
    created_at = lubridate::with_tz(created_at, tzone = "US/Central"), 
    created_day = lubridate::floor_date(created_at, "day"), 
    wday = lubridate::wday(created_at)
  ) %>%
  select(created_day, wday) %>%
  mutate(
    wday = factor(wday, levels = 1:7, labels = c("Su", "M", "T", "W", "Tr", "F", "Sa")),
    week = lubridate::floor_date(created_day, "week"),
    week = lubridate::as_date(week)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(week, wday) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  {
    weeks <- filter(., wday == "Su") %>% 
      pull(week)
    weeks <- weeks[seq_along(weeks) %% 2 == 0]
    week_labels <- strftime(weeks, "%b %d")
    
    ggplot(.) + 
      aes(week, wday, fill = n) +
      geom_tile(width = 0.90 * 7, height = 0.90) +
      coord_fixed(7) +
      theme_minimal(18, base_family = "PT Sans") +
      labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
      scale_x_date(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = weeks, labels = week_labels) +
      ggsci::scale_fill_material("deep-orange") +
      theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.margin = margin(1.5, 0, 1.5, 0)
      )
  }
```

What's really impressive is that, except for a few [Bismillah](https://twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag/status/1006312148497305601) and [Scaramouche](https://twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag/status/1017228225779511297) tweets, most of the tweets are really just 
[normal](https://twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag/status/1011437034035122178) 
[everyday](https://twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag/status/996618711535640577) 
[tweeting](https://twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag/status/1023396608426303489).
I'd love to get into a textual analysis, but it's late so I'll leave you with this:

`r blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "997437696476934144")`

Rock on! &#x1F918;
