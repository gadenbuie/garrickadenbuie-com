You can install rsthemes from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/rsthemes")
```

Then, install the included, hand-crafted themes with:

``` r
rsthemes::install_rsthemes()
```

or you can install the themes plus an additional set of [base16-based themes](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) with

``` r
rsthemes::install_rsthemes(include_base16 = TRUE)
```
