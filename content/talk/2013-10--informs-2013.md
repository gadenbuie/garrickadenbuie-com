talk_abstract: |
  Real-time monitoring of patient conditions in the ICU environment is essential
  in supporting clinical decisions and ensuring optimal allocation of medical
  resources. This study focuses on accurately predicting in-hospital ICU patient
  mortality utilizing functional profile data. We demonstrate that a boosted
  trees ensemble model is well suited for the diverse data typologies present in
  ICU data and provides an interpretable and accurate model to aid clinical
  experts in critical ICU decisions.
