<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Institutional honest brokers consolidate patient, clinical, and lab data from
a variety of data sources in order to provide investigators with
research-ready data sets. High-quality research data provisioning requires
skilled navigation of heterogeneous software systems and a detailed
understanding of data structure standards within each source. In this talk we
discuss how we, as honest brokers at a large cancer center, have created a
universe of internal R packages that simplify data access, store and present
metadata, standardize best practices, support reproducibility and
repeatability, apply branding styles to reports and visualizations, and
facilitate communication with the research data end user. Our package
ecosystem simplifies the workflow of honest brokers to scale curation and
delivery of high-quality research data.</p>
