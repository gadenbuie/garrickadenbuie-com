talk_abstract: |
  In the past century, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in life
  expectancy concurrent with a growth in elderly population. Between 2010 and
  2050, the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to more than double
  to exceed 88 million by 2050 in the United States. Ambient intelligence merges
  ubiquitous computing, embedded sensors, and artificial intelligence to
  monitor, adjust and respond to the environment of the user. This presentation
  will explore the potential of ambient intelligence for applications in health
  care, primarily with a focus on senior health care management.
