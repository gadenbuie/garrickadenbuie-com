talk_abstract: |
  Faced with a growing elderly population, learning and characterizing  activity
  profiles of smart home occupants will support senior health care management
  for older adults living in homes augmented by ambient intelligence solutions
  that combine ubiquitous computing and artificial intelligence. In this work,
  we explore a bag of n-grams approach for creating occupant-specific activity
  profiles from event streams collected from passive, embedded sensors in
  real-world sensor networks in the homes of several older adults.
