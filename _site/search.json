    "title": "Unsupervised behavior change detection using passive sensor systems in the homes of older adults",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nPurpose\nGlobally and within the United States, we face well-known and documented challenges driven by growth within the elderly segments of our population. The majority of adults over 65 are healthy but managing one or more chronic illnesses, and older adults and their informal caregivers—such as family members and friends—require supportive technologies that assist in monitoring and managing these conditions1 as they strive to maintain independence at home. An important goal of lifestyle reassurance monitoring is to alert older adults and their caregivers to changes in behavior or routine. In contrast with traditional activity recognition algorithms that require labelled activity data that is both difficult and expensive to collect2, we present a method for unsupervised behavior change detection that does not require explicit, higher-level activity labels and is effective when applied to real-world, natural, smart home activity data.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this project, we developed a passive sensor system that has been installed to date in the homes of 14 community-dwelling, older adults (aged 68 and above) who live alone and were of good health at the time of installation. Participants responded to a bi-weekly survey tracking the occurrence of health changes. Included in the sensor network are motion sensors for the generalized detection of presence throughout the home, and magnetic contact sensors for detection of interaction with entrance and exit doors and routinely used objects. All sensors are wireless, use the Z-Wave protocol, and are readily available commercially. The basis of the behavior change algorithm is the use of a bag of event sequence n-grams representation3 to summarize daily activity patterns in an activity profile and a permutation-based change detection algorithm4 to compare activity profiles of multiple days (e.g. a baseline period of activity) and individual or grouped activity profiles.\n\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe bag of event n-grams method was first validated as a supervised classification problem in which activity profiles were used to identify occupants from 6 homes with identical layouts. Activity profiles based on 4 and 6 weeks of activity led to correct identification of a given occupant for unlabelled days of activity with high accuracy (0.9593, 0.9624) and F1 (0.9590, 0.9621). The algorithm for unsupervised behavior change was applied to the activity data from four participants over a period of one year (one participant) or two years (three participants) who reported health changes ranging from acute episodes of illness to mobility restrictions leading to major surgery. Preliminary results reveal that comparison of activity profiles over time windows of 1 to 4 weeks reliably detects major shifts in behavior or other systematic disturbances such as guests in the home or sensor reliability issues. Linking the output of the algorithm to a notification system will alert family members, caregivers, and system administrators to trigger follow-up and review when such issues arise.\n\n\nReferences\n\nDemiris G, Hensel BK.

It turns out that a link to a Google Form on my iPhone is the perfect balance between ease and control.\nSo far, I’ve used this method as a time card to track working hours, to track my daily weight, to stay on top of a group project, and to monitor the chemical balance and consumption of my pool. With Google Forms it’s easy to design a form that specifically fits your needs – I’m sure there are a lot of other great ways this setup could be used."

Give the spreadsheet the name you want and move to the next step… actually building the form.\nAdd the form items that you need, and try to find a balance between ease of collection and integrity of the data. I’ve found that for numerical entries, the Plain Text format works best. If you want to allow multiple selections from a predetermined list, choose Checkboxes and then add your options. These will be stored in your spreadsheet as a single cell with a list of the selected options, ie: \"Option 1, Option 3\". You can also have a slider input on a scale of 1-5 or 0-10, but if precision is important – eg. you might need to record 6.7 – then skip this and use the plain text format.\n\nFor a the select only one option type item, the Choose from a list option works best, and shows up on the iPhone as a rolodex list. As an example, I’ve added a question for the number of cups of coffee I’ve had today.\n\nWhen you’re done with the questions, edit the form submitted confirmation response to something validating, like Good work, dude!, and decide if you want to allow edits. Then click Send Form and send the form to an email address that gets delivered to your phone."

Of course, it’s best to do any calculations on a new sheet so that your work isn’t lost when new responses are recorded. One limitation I’ve found is that columns are added to the spreadsheet as the items are added, so if you add a new item or rearrange questions in your form, the spreadsheet columns will be disorganized.\nOne of the greatest benefits of using Google Forms is that every entry is time stamped. Google’s timeline visualization is excellent, and once you have the data together it’s as easy as adding a chart."

Because writing should be easier.\nOn the flip side, when I write in LaTeX, I spend way too much time trying to figure out what commands will format text the way I want. Sure, the math is pretty and as long as I stick to the basic document classes things tend to look good. But the structure of Markdown is just so much easier that it gets out of the way of what I want to say. When you need the power of LaTeX, then it’s incredible.

That can be done using the following flag:--bibliography=/Users/.../Documents/PapersLibraryFull.bib\nDownload citation styles from zotero.org and save them somewhere safe. I’ve created a folder in my home directory ~/.pandoc for storing these things, and I put my .csl files in ~/.pandoc/csl.To specify the citation style, use the --csl flag:--csl /Users/.../.pandoc/csl/ieee-with-url.csl\nIt’d be nice if the citation were inserted as a link to the full reference in the references section.

(Or is it half empty?) I never seem to make it all the way through before a new notebook comes along, or a new project or turn in my life creates a thematic change that requires breaking out of the old patterns of the old notebook.\nSo let’s hope this online notebook gets some notes.

    "text": "I had the great pleasure of spending some time with Dr. Richard Fenner, of the University of Cambridge, who is in the process of writing a new book on educating engineers for sustainability.\nThe talk was subtitled “Principles into Practice,” which is also the subtitle of his forthcoming book.\nI realized, through our talks and during his presentation, that while we have been very good as a culture at educating engineers in the application of scientific principles, we’ve also created a breed of engineer that learns how to solve a problem in a particular way… at which point many new problems look like old problems and get solved in old, familiar ways.\nHe gave the example of the Army Corps of Engineers in the New Deal days, who were completely capable of damming rivers that had no business being dammed, only because they were good at building dams and had the money and skill to do so.\nI have friends who spend much of their lives lobbying for the removal of these dams. It turns out a dam that has no business being a dam is also highly detrimental to the local ecology.\nIt was great to hear his views on educating engineers in the new design criteria of sustainable development, and we had a few great conversations about what exactly sustainable actually means.\nHis program, like the masters program at the Patel School for Global Sustainability, trains students in critical sustainability practices, philosophies and ways of thinking. As an engineer – or at least as a graduate of a highly engineering-focused school – it was great to hear about new programs that build sustainability thinking on top of the foundation of engineering and “hard science.”\nI look forward to reading Dr. Fenner’s book when it is published – I’ll be sure to share it here."

Use it when an a column contains observations from multiple variables.\n\ngather(data, key = \"key\", value = \"value\", ...)\n\nGather takes multiple columns and collapses into key-value pairs, duplicating all other columns as needed.

    "text": "Jump to: Try Online | Installation | Usage (app | report) | Data Format | Built With\nMany educators design multiple-choice question examination. How do we know that these tests are valid and reliable? How can we improve upon the test by way of modifying, revising and deleting items based on student responses?\nIn a paper in the highly regarded Journal of Engineering Education, Jorion, et al (2016) developed “an analytical framework for evaluating the validity of concept inventory claims”. We believe that we can use this framework to help educators design their multiple-choice tests as well, especially, if they are designed as the final mastery examination in a course. An open source software to analyze a multiple-choice question examination would be encouraging to educators who have minimal programming experience and promising to contributors who would enhance the program.\nThis R package provides useful interfaces and functions to assist with the analysis of data from a typical multiple-choice test. The user needs only to provide an answer key that optionally identifies the concept or topic of each question and a table of responses given by each student to the questions in the test. MCTestAnalysis provides a Shiny web app interface and an automatic report-generation tool featuring concepts from Classical Test Theory (CTT), Item Response Theory (IRT) and structural analysis. We regard this package to be a work-in-progress and encourage contributions. At this time CTT results include item difficulty, item discrimination, Cronbach’s alpha, and alpha-with-item-deleted. Item response functions include model estimation and item characteristic curves. Tetrachoric and scree plots are included with an introductory exploratory factor analysis."

Also, @aronatkins really likes 🍎 #rstudioconf pic.twitter.com/g2OC2lTnJc\n— Larie (@lariebyrd) February 3, 2018\n\nIn his talk, he designed a parameterized RMarkdown report that would provide the user with a customized report for their selected fruit and pulling in images from the USDA Pomological Watercolor Collection. I had never heard of the pomological watercolors – or the fan club twitter account @pomological – until watching his talk. It’s a treasure trove of thousands of watercolor images of fruits; beautiful images with intricate details and a very unique and stunning palette. The perfect palette for a custom ggplot2 theme.\n\n\nThe collection spans the years 1886 to 1942. The majority of the paintings were created between 1894 and 1916. The plant specimens represented by these artworks originated in 29 countries and 51 states and territories in the U.S. There are 7,497 watercolor paintings, 87 line drawings, and 79 wax models created by approximately 21 artists. [USDA National Agricultural Library]\n\nI pulled together a small set of functions into a simple package called ggpomological that provides a custom, pomological-inspired ggplot2 theme.\nBefore reading more about ggpomological, you should really check out Aron’s talk or his slides."

To opt into the full pomological effect, use theme_pomological_fancy() which is just an alias for theme_pomological(base_family = \"Homemade Apple\", base_size = 16)."

Turns out, an .rstheme is just CSS!\nThis got me half the way there, but there were still a number of missing elements that I wanted to tweak. Figuring out how tmTheme scopes get mapped to Ace CSS classes was painful trial and error. To get the theme all the way there, I went straight to the source. I opened up a few scripts and R Markdown documents, used Insepect Element to identify the appropriate Ace CSS class, and then fiddled until it looked great good enough.\nThe blinking Christmas-light cursor is just a CSS animation!\n.normal-mode .ace_cursor {\n  border: 0!important;\n  animation-name: color;\n  animation-duration: 10s;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-timing-function: step-start;\n  opacity: 0.75;\n}\n\n@keyframes color {\n  0% {\n    background-color: #ff00a9;\n  }\n  20% {\n    background-color: #7c3eff;\n  }\n  40% {\n    background-color: #64f3f0;\n  }\n  60% {\n    background-color: #4fe818;\n  }\n  80% {\n    background-color: #ffc400;\n  }\n  100 {\n    background-color: #ff0010;\n  }\n}\n\n⚠️ May waste some CPU cycles in the spirit of the holidays!\nThe animated christmas-light cursors may increase the CPU usage of RStudio.

    "section": "Intro",
    "text": "Intro\nI started this post about a month ago, roughly at the same time that every other person with a blog about doing things with computers also decided to start writing a post about Wordle.\nI’ve been tempted to just walk away from this post more than once. After all, since I’ve started writing this post Wordle has been solved more than once, Winston Chang rewrote Wordle in Shiny, roughly 70 other people wrote Wordle clones or helper apps and packages in R alone. Felienne Hermans wrote a Twitter bot to guess the word from shared game emojis. Someone else wrote a bot to intentionally ruin everyone’s day by spoling the answer to the next day’s Wordle. (Both bots were eventually suspended by Twitter.) Oh and Wordle was bought for big money by the New York Times who fumbled the handoff and lost more than a few player’s word streaks in the transfer.\nI should admit up-front that I’ve never really played Wordle. It’s exactly the kind of task that immediately cries out to be automated: I’d apparently much rather spend a month’s worth of after-hours tinkering time to think through and codify a decent strategy than to just think up some words on my own.\nAnd yet I love Wordle. I think it’s awesome. The rules are simple, but deceptively ambiguous. The game play is so concise it can fit in a tweet (even though that’s annoying for accessibility reasons). Still, the UI is simple, intuitive and fun without trying to hack your brain to be addictive. It’s a feel good game.\nAnother reason to love Wordle: there are so many great programming tasks around Wordle. It’s easy to describe the mechanics, to understand the game play, to look at the app and think: I can do that. Which is why, right now, programmers are hard at work tinkering over word lists or practicing web development in their favorite framework using Wordle.\nAs an educator, it means you can tailor a Wordle-based programming challenge to be as simple or complicated as needed. Once you start to break down the game, it’s more complicated than it appears at first glance, and there’s so much to choose from. State management, data structures, browser storage, game theory, CSS, user interface design, accessibility. You can go deep on any of these topics.\nSo if you have a Wordle idea you want to tinker with, I wholeheartedly encourage you to run with it. Let Wordle inspire you to practice using regular expressions with stringr, web scraping with httr, text processing with Python, working with Twitter data with rtweet, or making accessible plots with ggplot2.\nWhat follows here is a bit of a journey. It is not the best strategy for Wordle or even the best way to play. But along the way we’ll learn a few text processing tricks, we’ll write a few functions, and we’ll learn how to move seamlessly from R to the browser in the same document or blog post. (The R code and data I write below create the word data used in the table and app above!)"

What if we know that R and F are in the word: which is a more likely choice as the fourth letter?\nTo do this we…\n\nFirst turn the word list into a tibble with one row per word.\nThen, using tidyr::separate_rows(), we can add a new column with the letters in each word.\nGrouping by word and adding a row_number() gives us the position of each letter in the word.\nThen we can count the number of times each letter occurs in a given position with a new group_by() and summarize() (we could have used count() with another ungroup(), too).\nThen, if we re-use our letter-word counts from the last step, we can count the number of words that have a the letter in question so that our frequency is effectively given the letter R, how often does it appear as the fourth letter?\nFinally, tidyr::pivot_wider() moves the positions to the columns so the table is easier to read.\n\n\nletter_freq_pos &lt;-\n  tibble(word = words) %&gt;%\n  select(word) %&gt;%\n  mutate(letter = word) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::separate_rows(letter, sep = \"\") %&gt;%\n  filter(letter != \"\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(word) %&gt;%\n  mutate(position = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  group_by(letter, position) %&gt;%\n  summarize(n = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    words = letter_freq[letter] * length(!!words),\n    freq = n / words\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-n, -words) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(\n    names_from = position,\n    values_from = freq,\n    values_fill = 0,\n    names_prefix = \"p\"\n  )\n\nletter_freq_pos\n\n# A tibble: 26 × 6\n   letter     p1     p2     p3    p4     p5\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 a      0.138  0.425  0.232  0.202 0.128 \n 2 b      0.598  0.0533 0.221  0.160 0.0388\n 3 c      0.480  0.0917 0.204  0.214 0.0661\n 4 d      0.298  0.0366 0.170  0.205 0.358 \n 5 e      0.0531 0.285  0.155  0.408 0.267 \n 6 f      0.604  0.0242 0.180  0.235 0.0828\n 7 g      0.413  0.0493 0.236  0.274 0.0927\n 8 h      0.286  0.320  0.0703 0.138 0.217 \n 9 i      0.0460 0.385  0.293  0.245 0.0780\n10 j      0.699  0.0381 0.159  0.100 0.0104\n# … with 16 more rows\n\n\nNow we can answer our question about R and F in the fourth position.\n\nletter_freq_pos %&gt;%\n  filter(letter %in% c(\"r\", 'f')) %&gt;%\n  select(letter, p4)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  letter    p4\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 f      0.235\n2 r      0.184\n\n\nSo R is the fourth letter in 18% of the words containing R — but F is the fourth letter in 24% of its words.\nIdeally this information will help us filter guesses when we know that a set of letters are in the solution, but we don’t yet know where."

    "text": "First Choice\nWhat word should we guess first? Ideally, we want a word whose answer gives us the most information. Intuitively, if we pick a word that has the most popular letters and each letter is different, we’ll be able to discard or include the most words when Wordle tells us which letters are in or out.\nFormally, this calculation is called entropy. It measures how much information is contained in a particular instance of a random process. In this case, words with higher entropy give us more information because they encode more information.\nThis is all a little hand-wavy, so I’ll just duck the details and call this number a score. The higher the score, the better the word choice.\nTo calculate the entropy score, we take a word, split it into it’s letters, and then get the probability of each letter appearing in the word. Duplicated letters don’t tell us much, so we set second appearances of a letter close to zero. And then we calculate entropy\n\\[-\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\log_2 p_i\\]\nwhich in R code is\n- sum(p * log(p, base = 2))\nwhere p is a vector of probabilities for a given outome.\nWe can wrap all of that up into a function score_entropy():\n\nscore_entropy &lt;- function(word) {\n  chars &lt;- str_split(word, \"\")[[1]]\n  p &lt;- letter_freq[chars]\n  # we learn something but not much from duplicated letters\n  p[duplicated(chars)] &lt;- min(letter_freq)\n  - sum(p * log(p, base = 2))\n}\n\nNotice that score_entropy() isn’t vectorized, so we’ll have to use a map() function to call it over a vector of words. We can be even more specific and use map_dbl() since we know that score_entropy() returns a number.\n\nc(\"unhip\", \"jeans\", \"pools\") %&gt;%\n  set_names() %&gt;%\n  map_dbl(score_entropy)\n\n   unhip    jeans    pools \n2.232150 2.163479 1.994939 \n\n\nThis tells us, broadly, that unhip is a better choice than jeans and pools is worse than either. (Intuitively: you don’t learn much from the second O.)\nLet’s use this to create a table of words and their associated entropy scores. Taking a peek at the highest scoring words tells us…\n\nwords_first_choice &lt;-\n  tibble(word = words) %&gt;%\n  mutate(score = map_dbl(word, score_entropy)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(score))\n\nwords_first_choice\n\n# A tibble: 12,972 × 2\n   word  score\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 arose  2.61\n 2 aeros  2.61\n 3 soare  2.61\n 4 arise  2.60\n 5 raise  2.60\n 6 aesir  2.60\n 7 reais  2.60\n 8 serai  2.60\n 9 osier  2.59\n10 realo  2.59\n# … with 12,962 more rows\n\n\n… that according to this measure, the best first-choice words are arose, aeros, and soare. arose uses all five of the letters that most commonly appear in a word, and is also probably (okay, it is) on the answers list, so hello new first word choice!"

    "text": "Make it an app\nIt’s awesome being able to run R code to test things out, but it’s also a little tedious. Since we’ve done the heavy lifting of prepping and scoring words, it’d be great if we could have a little web app that would help us\n\nInput our guesses and results\nShow us possible words after each round\n\nAnd since I’m writing this blog post in R Markdown via blogdown, I can do it all right here!\n\nMove the data from R to the web\nThe first thing we need to do is save our data in a way that it can be accessed by JavaScript in the browser. To do this, we’ll take our words_scored table and use jsonlite::write_json() to save the data frame as JSON.\n\nwords_scored %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(starts_with(\"score\"), round, digits = 2)) %&gt;%\n  jsonlite::write_json(\"wordle-scored.json\")\n\nNow we have the data in a JSON file (that you can download if you want).\nBut to make life even easier, I’m going to use a trick I learned from htmlwidgets. What we can do is embed in the JSON file, which is only 589K, in a &lt;script type=\"application/json\"&gt; tag with a specific id that makes it easy to find later on.\n\nhtmltools::tags$script(\n  id = \"words-scored\",\n  type = \"application/json\",\n  readLines(\"wordle-scored.json\")\n)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have the data in a place where we can get it, let’s switch gears and write some JavaScript!\n\n\nStart working in JavaScript\nHere’s the cool thing: from here on out, the actual computation of the rest of the blog post is done in your browser. To facilitate this, I’ll use an extension I built for knitr for literate JavaScript programming with the js4shiny package.\n\njs4shiny\nSetting up literate JavaScript in blogdown is pretty straight-forward thanks to a little helper function from js4shiny.\n\njs4shiny::html_setup_blogdown(stylize = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidyjs\nThe other cool thing we’ll use is tidyjs. It’s a really neat JavaScript library that makes it easy to work with data frames in the browser. If you squint really hard, it’s remarkably similar to the tidyverse, just with a JavaScript spin.\nI wrapped tidyjs in an R package that automatically stays up to date with the latest version of tidyjs. To use tidyjs, we just need to call use_tidyjs().\n\ntidyjs::use_tidyjs()\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve included tidyjs in this page, we can finally switch to writing JavaScript instead of R.\nFirst, we need to import a couple of functions from tidyjs that we’re going to want to use. With tidyjs, all transformations are wrapped in a call tidy(), so we have to import tidy. We also need filter() and sliceMax() for easy filtering.\n\nconst { tidy, filter, sliceMax } = Tidy\n\n\n\n\nLoad our data\nThe next step is to find the JSON data that we just serialized and stashed in our page. We can use document.getElementById() to find the element with the id 'words-scored', and then grab the JSON text itself from the .innerText property of that object. Finally, we call JSON.parse() on the json text to parse it into a JavaScript object.\n\nwordsScored = JSON.parse(\n  document.getElementById('words-scored').innerText\n)\n\n\n\n\nPreview the data\nHere’s a quick preview of the data. In tidyjs you wrap a pipeline in tidy() and then each additional argument to tidy() is the next step in the pipe. To make it look a little more familiar to R users, I’ve added the %&gt;% in the comments.\n\ntidy(\n  wordsScored, // %&gt;%\n  sliceMax(5, 'score')\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame song, different dance\n\nSummarizing guesses\nNext, we translate summarize_guesses() from R to summarizeGuesses() in JavaScript.\n\nfunction summarizeGuesses ({ guesses, results }) {\n  // Check that all guesses and results have 5 characters\n  const allComplete = [...guesses, ...results].every(s =&gt; s.length == 5)\n  if (!allComplete) {\n    console.error('All guesses and results must have 5 characters.')\n    return\n  }\n\n  // R: str_split(x, '')\n  guesses = guesses.map(s =&gt; s.split(''))\n  results = results.map(s =&gt; s.split(''))\n\n  let exclude = Array(5).fill('')\n  let exact = Array(5).fill('')\n  let keep = []\n  let discard = []\n\n  for (i = 0; i &lt; guesses.length; i++) {\n    let g = guesses[i] // g: an array of 5 letters of a guess\n    let r = results[i] // r: an array of 5 letters of the result\n\n    for (j = 0; j &lt; r.length; j++) {\n      if (r[j] == '+') {\n        // this letter is exactly right\n        exact[j] = g[j]\n        keep.push(g[j])\n      } else if (r[j] == '-') {\n        // this letter is included, wrong place\n        keep.push(g[j])\n        // so exclude it from this position\n        exclude[j] += g[j]\n      } else {\n        // this letter isn't in the solution\n        discard.push(g[j])\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  // build up the regex pattern blending `exact` and `exclude`\n  const pattern = Array(5).fill('.')\n  for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n    if (exact[i] != '') {\n      pattern[i] = exact[i]\n    } else if (exclude[i] != '') {\n      pattern[i] = `[^${exclude[i]}]`\n    }\n  }\n\n  discard = discard.filter(x =&gt; !keep.includes(x))\n  return {discard, keep, pattern: pattern.join('')}\n}\n\n\nHere’s a quick preview of summarizeGuesses().\n\nlet summary = summarizeGuesses({\n  guesses: [\"arose\", \"indol\"],\n  results: [\"..-..\", \"+..+-\"]\n})\nconsole.log(summary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for the next word\nAnd then we need to do the same for score_next_guess(). Of course, at this point I’m older and wiser and choose a better name: searchNextGuess().\n\nfunction searchNextGuess ({ guesses, results }) {\n  const guessResult = summarizeGuesses({guesses, results})\n\n  return tidy(\n    wordsScored,\n    // discard words that contain a letter in the discard pile\n    filter(d =&gt; !guessResult.discard.some(l =&gt; d.word.includes(l))),\n    // keep only words that have all letters in the keep pile\n    filter(d =&gt; guessResult.keep.every(l =&gt; d.word.includes(l))),\n    // keep words that are consistent with results to date\n    filter(d =&gt; RegExp(guessResult.pattern).test(d.word))\n  )\n}\n\n\nLet’s prove to ourselves that these functions work.\n\nlet next = searchNextGuess({\n  guesses: [\"arose\", \"indol\"],\n  results: [\"..-..\", \"+..+-\"]\n})\n\nconsole.log(`There is ${next.length} word available for our next guess:`)\nconsole.table(next[0])\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try again. What if we chose a different second guess?\n\nlet rounds = {\n  guesses: [\"arose\", \"intro\"],\n  results: [\".--..\", \"..+--\"]\n}\nlet next = searchNextGuess(rounds)\n\nconsole.log('Guess summary ----')\nconsole.log(summarizeGuesses(rounds))\n\nconsole.log('Next word choices ----')\nnext.forEach(ws =&gt; console.log(`${ws.word} (${ws.score})`))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow build the rest of the owl\nOkay, this is the point where I confess that I went way off-track in building the little app at the top of this post. I fully intended to write about that part too, but honestly I’ve done a good job curing myself of the Wordle bug with this post.\nFor the curious, all the JavaScript code for the guess helper lives in wordle-component.js. Or, right click on this page and pick Inspect Element and find your way to the Sources or Debugger tab for a better look. It’s all vanilla JavaScript.\nAlso a quick shout-out to gridjs, which turned out to be a very easy way to create the table of sorted words.\n&lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/gridjs/dist/gridjs.umd.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;link href=\"https://unpkg.com/gridjs/dist/theme/mermaid.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;"

    "text": "Our Experience with Programming Languages\nLet’s dive into the results. If you’re interested in taking a peek behind the regular expressions curtain, I’ve included a code walkthrough below.\nThe original tweet asked for six categories: First language, Had difficulties, Most used, Totally hate, Most loved, For beginners. Replies to this tweet were… creative. The category names and formatting were hand-typed, so flexible and prone to spelling errors and permutations.\nTo get the broadest range of answers possible, I used flexible regular expressions to accept a variety of formatting choices, and I also widened the categories to encompass the same core themes. For example, first love, secret love, and mostly loved all were added to the Most loved category, which I called, simply, love.\nI also captured multiple programming languages in each category (even the original tweet had multiple answers for first language (Basic/Java) and a few other categories).\nEach of the following plots shows the top 20 responses in each category.\n\nFirst Language vs. Recommended First Language\nHow do the first languages learned by programmers compare to the languages they would recommend to others to learn first? Many people started with older languages like Basic, C, Pascal, C++ and Java but would recommend new programmers start with Python, JavaScript, Ruby and also C or Java.\n     \n\n\nLove It or Hate It\nWhich programming languages are loved and which languages are not? The world seems to have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript, but Python is much more loved than hated. Likewise Swift, Ruby, and Go are significantly more positive than negative, C++ is also a bit love/hate, and PHP certainly isn’t feeling the love.\n     \n\n\nMost Used or Had Difficulties\nWhich languages are most used compared with those that have caused difficulties? JavaScript is eating the world, and plenty of people are using workhorse languages like Python, Java and C#/C++. (And a quite a few are using PHP presumably because they have to.) Still, JavaScript’s love/hate relationship continues as many people indicated that it caused them problems. I’m not surprised to see C++, C, and Java on the had difficulties list. Interestingly, Haskell shows up in the loved list but seems to also be tricky to learn.\n     \n\n\nFeelings about #rstats\nHow do developers feel about my favorite language? R isn’t a typical first language, but it is among the top 20 recommended to new programmers to learn first. It’s also the 12th most used language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nRank\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nmost used\n12\n1456\n\n\nlove\n15\n2067\n\n\nhad difficulties\n19\n2092\n\n\nhate\n16\n2641\n\n\nbeginner\n17\n2296\n\n\nfirst language\n28\n1508\n\n\ncurious\n15\n207\n\n\ncurrently\n2\n63\n\n\nnext\n3\n50\n\n\nhonerable mention\n8\n98\n\n\nchronology\n25\n29\n\n\nalso used, eager to learn, frenemy, never studied, on my list, to learn, totally meh, willing to learn"

    "text": "Code Walkthrough\nAt a high level, the process for cleaning and standardizing the tweet repsonses looks like this. I abstracted some of the larger steps in the pipeline into separate functions.\n\nPre-clean the tweet text, including remove_unused_text()\nSeparate tweets so that each line or item of the tweet is in its own row using tidyr::separate_rows()\n\nItems are indicated by N., N), N:, or N-, or just appear on a new line without numbering.\n\nRemove whitespace and any numbering from each line\nSeparate each line into a question category and answer pair by splitting on : using tidyr::separate()\nFilter out empty answers and convert everything to lower case\nUse a set of regular expressions to process_answer() into individual languages\nUse more regular expressions to recode_answer() and recode_category(), fixing spelling mistakes and combining overlapping groups\nCount the number of replies mentioning each programming language by category\n\nThe whole pipeline is summarized below, including the function to plot response counts by category.\n\nRemove Unused Text\nThis little function removes usernames (@user), URLs, parenthetical comments, and turns #hashtag into hashtag because many people specified their choices using language hashtags, like #rstats instead of r.\n\nremove_unused_text &lt;- function(text) {\n  text %&gt;%\n    # strip usernames\n    str_remove_all(\"@\\\\w+\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n    # strip URLs\n    str_remove_all(\"\\\\s*http[^ ]+\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n    # remove parentheticals\n    str_remove_all(\"\\\\s*\\\\(.+?\\\\)( |\\n|$)\") %&gt;%\n    # replace \"#hashtag\" with \"hashtag\"\n    str_replace_all(\"#(\\\\w)\", \"\\\\1\")\n}\n\n\n\nProcess Answer\nThe goal in processing the answers is to transform each answer to a single string of comma separated languages. In doing this, common variations of language lists should result in the same final answers. For example, Python and R, Python/R, and Python or R should all be handled similarly. To help with this process I created a list of common languages that frequently appear in the answers.\n\ncommon_langs &lt;- c(\n  # c, c#, c++, and .net are manually included later\n  \"css\", \"html\", \"python\", \"javascript\", \"x86\", \"java\", \"ruby\", \"pascal\", \"php\",\n  \"matlab\", \"perl\", \"fortran\", \"logo\", \"actionscript\", \"lua\", \"assembly\",\n  \"delphi\", \"js\", \"scheme\", \"scratch\", \"go\", \"typescript\", \"clojure\", \"elixr\",\n  \"kotlin\", \"ocaml\", \"rust\", \"mathematica\", \"matlab\", \"dart\", \"flutter\", \"groovy\",\n  \"flash\", \"bash\", \"shell\", \"sql\", \"haskell\", \"lisp\", \"scala\", \"sas\",\n  \"rstats\", \"golang\"\n)\n\nThen, with a bit of regex kung fu, the responses are converted from Python and R to python,r.\n\nprocess_answer &lt;- function(answer, common_langs) {\n  answer %&gt;%\n    # Aggresively remove unusual characters\n    str_replace_all(\"[^\\\\w\\\\d#+., ]\", \" \") %&gt;%\n    # Remove leading character if it's a `,`\n    str_replace_all(\"^,\", \" \") %&gt;%\n    # Remove `.` at end of string\n    str_remove_all(\"[.]$\") %&gt;%\n    # Replace and, or with space (prep for next step)\n    str_replace_all(\"\\\\b(and|or|also|amp)\\\\b\", \" \") %&gt;%\n    # Remove qualifiers\n    str_remove_all(\"\\\\b(maybe|now)\\\\b\") %&gt;%\n    # Multiple languages may be listed separated by spaces, if so add comma\n    str_replace_all(\n      pattern = paste0(\"\\\\b(\", paste(common_langs, collapse = \"|\"), \")\\\\b\\\\s*\"),\n      replacement = \"\\\\1,\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    gsub(\"c\\\\+\\\\+\\\\d+\", \"c++\", .) %&gt;%\n    # Comma separate languages that are tough to regex\n    gsub(\"c \", \"c,\", ., fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    gsub(\".net \", \".net,\", ., fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    gsub(\"c# \", \"c#,\", ., fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    gsub(\"c++ \", \"c++,\", ., fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    # No trailing punctuation\n    str_remove(\"[.,!?/=&lt;&gt;;:]+$\")\n}\n\n\n\nRecode Answer\nThere are a number of programming languages that have multiple variants or are commonly referred to by shorthand names — rstats for R or golang for go, for example. This function recodes the programming language answers that I noticed while working with the data (but it’s admitedly not complete).\n\nrecode_answer &lt;- function(answer) {\n  # Recode Basic Variants\n  answer &lt;- recode(answer, \"vb\" = \"visual basic\")\n  answer &lt;- if_else(str_detect(answer, \"visual.*basic\"), \"visual basic\", answer)\n  answer &lt;- if_else(str_detect(answer, \"q.*basic\"), \"qbasic\", answer)\n  answer &lt;- if_else(str_detect(answer, \"gw.*basic\"), \"gw basic\", answer)\n  answer &lt;- if_else(str_detect(answer, \"(?&lt;!(visual|q|gw)\\\\s?)basic\"), \"basic\", answer)\n  # Recode Pascal variants\n  answer &lt;- if_else(str_detect(answer, \"pascal\"), \"pascal\", answer)\n  # Recode js vs Javascript\n  answer &lt;- recode(answer, \"js\" = \"javascript\")\n  # Recode golang to go\n  answer &lt;- recode(answer, \"golang\" = \"go\")\n  # Recode rstats as r\n  recode(answer, \"rstats\" = \"r\")\n}\n\n\n\nRecode Category\nAs you might imagine with a free-form survey where users manually enter both the question and the answer, there is a large amount of variation in the spelling and categories used.\nI broadly grouped many of the variations into common themes, primarily working to fit the original prompt. There are many, many interesting created categories, like best dead language, didn't spark joy, or latest crush. Here are two additional categories that I created, curious and interesting.\n     \n\nrecode_category &lt;- function(category) {\n  case_when(\n    str_detect(category, \"first.+lang(uage)?|firstlanguage\") ~ \"first language\",\n    str_detect(category, \"^first$\") ~ \"first language\",\n    str_detect(category, \"b(e|i)ginn?e|new dev|newb|starter|noob|brginners|begginners|begginers\") ~ \"beginner\",\n    str_detect(category, \"want|would|wish|wanna|curious|desire|(like.+learn)|curios|(like to try)\") ~ \"curious\",\n    str_detect(category, \"m[ou]st?(ly)? ?used?\") ~ \"most used\",\n    str_detect(category, \"diff?.+c.+lt|diificulties|difficulies|difficuties|difficulities\") ~ \"had difficulties\",\n    str_detect(category, \"love\") ~ \"love\",\n    str_detect(category, \"hate|dislike|avoid|(don.?t.+like)\") ~ \"hate\",\n    str_detect(category, \"promis|interest|exotic|esoter|(most excited)|(weird)\") ~ \"interesting\",\n    str_detect(category, \"honou?rable mention\") ~ \"honerable mention\",\n    str_detect(category, \"next|need to learn\") ~ \"next\",\n    str_detect(category, \"others used|other lang|dabbl\") ~ \"others used\",\n    str_detect(category, \"current\") ~ \"currently\",\n    TRUE ~ category\n  )\n}\n\n\n\nPoll Processing Pipeline\nFinally, here is the full pipeline to go from raw tweets to poll results.\n\ntweets_lang_poll &lt;-\n  tweets %&gt;%\n  select(status_id, created_at, user_id, screen_name, text) %&gt;%\n  # Remove tweets with \"English\" because that's probably a different thread\n  filter(!str_detect(text, \"[eE]nglish\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Backup original tweet text\n    text_og = text,\n    # Remove unused text from tweets\n    text = remove_unused_text(text)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Split text into question/answer pairs,\n  # splitting on newline or one of: `N.`, `N)`, `N:`, or `N-`\n  separate_rows(text, sep = \"\\n|\\\\d\\\\s*[.):-]\") %&gt;%\n  # Remove whitespace and `N.` numbers from start of text\n  mutate(text = str_remove_all(text, \"^\\\\s*(\\\\d[.):-])?\\\\s*\")) %&gt;%\n  # Seperate question/answer into category, answer columns, splitting on colon `:`\n  separate(\n    col = text,\n    into = c(\"category\", \"answer\"),\n    sep = \"\\\\s*:\\\\s*\",\n    remove = FALSE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Remove nothing answers or answers without any letters\n  filter(\n    !is.na(answer),\n    str_detect(answer, \"[[:alnum:]]\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Re-encode category, answer as UTF-8 (:shrug:) and lowercase\n  mutate_at(vars(category, answer), stringi::stri_enc_toutf8) %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(category, answer), tolower) %&gt;%\n  # Category: Remove leading non-alpha characters and squish whitespace\n  mutate(\n    category = str_remove(category, \"^[^[:alpha:]]+\"),\n    category = str_squish(category)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Process answer as well as we can programmatically\n  mutate(answer = process_answer(answer, common_langs)) %&gt;%\n  # Separate into one language per row\n  separate_rows(answer, sep = \"\\\\s*[,/]\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n  # Squish the strings\n  mutate_at(vars(answer), str_squish) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    answer = recode_answer(answer),\n    category2 = recode_category(category)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Filter out empty category, answer fields\n  filter(!str_detect(answer, \"^\\\\s*$\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    nchar(answer) &gt; 0,\n    nchar(category) &gt; 4\n  )\n\nAnd then to aggregate and count programming language mentions per category.\n\ntweets_lang_counted &lt;-\n  tweets_lang_poll %&gt;%\n  count(category2, answer, sort = TRUE)\n\n\n\nPlot Language Counts by Category\nLast, but not least, this function creates the plots for requested categories. One key detail is that bars are ordered within each facet using tidytext’s reorder_within() function. Check out Julia Silge’s excellent blog post on this function: Reordering and facetting for ggplot2.\nWhile the bars are ordered in descending order, I wanted the bar fill color to be consistent across facets to facilitate comparison between the two categories. The color palette is ocean.deep from the pals package, which I found by looking through Emil Hvitfeldt’s Comprehensive list of color palettes in R.\n\nplot_tweets_by_category &lt;- function(\n  tweets_lang_counted,\n  categories,\n  ncol = 2,\n  min_count = 10\n) {\n  tweets_lang_counted %&gt;%\n    filter(category2 %in% categories) %&gt;%\n    mutate_at(vars(category2), factor, levels = categories) %&gt;%\n    group_by(category2) %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%\n    filter(n &gt;= min_count) %&gt;%\n    top_n(20, n) %&gt;%\n    ungroup() %&gt;%\n    arrange(category2, answer, desc(n)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      answer_within = tidytext::reorder_within(answer, n, category2),\n      answer = fct_reorder(answer, n, first)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(answer_within, n, fill = answer) +\n    geom_col() +\n    coord_flip() +\n    tidytext::scale_x_reordered(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n    discrete_scale(\"fill\", \"ocean\", function(n) rev(pals::ocean.deep(n + 10))[6:(n+5)]) +\n    guides(fill = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n    facet_wrap(~ category2, scales = \"free\", ncol = ncol) +\n    theme_minimal(base_family = \"PT Sans\", base_size = 18) +\n    theme(\n      plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20),\n      panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n      panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n      axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(family = \"PT Sans Narrow\"),\n      axis.text.y.left = element_text(margin = margin()),\n      panel.spacing.x = unit(3, \"line\"),\n      panel.spacing.y = unit(2, \"line\")\n    )\n}"

With signed commits, you cryptographically sign each commit with your private key that only you own, and GitHub (and others) will verify your signature with the public key pair. When GitHub knows that the real you made the commit, it adds the green  badge.\nIn this post, I’ll show you how to use Keybase to create your own GPG key.

It manages the cryptographic steps: signing or encoding files with your personal GPG key.\nKeybase is key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys in a publicly auditable manner3. In other words, Keybase is place to store encryption keys and to link your identity (and those keys) to your public identities such as your accounts on Twitter or GitHub. One advantage of Keybase is that its app and command line tool make it relatively easy to generate and store GPG keys. It’s also a great way to share that key between your own computers.\n\n\nCreate a GPG key with Keybase\nIf you don’t have a Keybase account, open the Keybase app that we installed with brew. Their app will guide you through the process of creating an account.\nOnce you have a Keybase account, head back to the command line4 to create a new GPG key. Note that the keybase cli uses the pgp command, but we’ve been talking about GPG keys. To most people, the terms GPG and PGP are functionally interchangeable: GPG is the GNU Privacy Guard which is an open-source version of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).\nkeybase pgp gen --multi\nEnter your real name, which will be publicly visible in your new key: Garrick Aden-Buie\nEnter a public email address for your key: garrick@adenbuie.com\nEnter another email address (or &lt;enter&gt; when done):\nPush an encrypted copy of your new secret key to the Keybase.io server? [Y/n] Y\nWhen exporting to the GnuPG keychain, encrypt private keys with a passphrase? [Y/n] Y\n▶ INFO PGP User ID: Garrick Aden-Buie &lt;garrick@adenbuie.com&gt; [primary]\n▶ INFO Generating primary key (4096 bits)\n▶ INFO Generating encryption subkey (4096 bits)\n▶ INFO Generated new PGP key:\n▶ INFO   user: Garrick Aden-Buie &lt;garrick@adenbuie.com&gt;\n▶ INFO  4096-bit RSA key, ID B606B038A1A5CE20, created 2021-09-12\n▶ INFO Exported new key to the local GPG keychain\nTo recap the process:\n\nkeybase will first ask you for your real name and email address. Make sure these match your identity on GitHub, or at least a verified email that you use on GitHub.\nThen choose Y to push a copy of the key to Keybase and Y again to add give your private key a passphrase.\nAfter a few seconds, Keybase asks for your account password and then prompts you to enter a passphrase for your GPG key.\n\nAt the end of the output, note your key’s ID — in my case, B606B038A1A5CE20. You should also be able to find your key on your Keybase profile, or list your local keys that gpg knows about with\ngpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG\n/Users/garrick/.gnupg/pubring.kbx\n---------------------------------\nsec   rsa4096/B606B038A1A5CE20 2021-09-13 [SC] [expires: 2037-09-09]\n      87888BBEBC09E6093A8310F9B606B038A1A5CE20\nuid                 [ unknown] Garrick Aden-Buie &lt;garrick@adenbuie.com&gt;\nssb   rsa4096/F4435076C9C363BD 2021-09-13 [E] [expires: 2037-09-09]\nNotice that we again see our key id, B606B038A1A5CE20, in the third line of the output. There’s also the [ unknown] on line 5 next to our name. This indicates that gpg isn’t totally confident about this key yet and we need to tell gpg that it can be trusted.\n\n\nTrust your own key, ultimately\nOpen the gpg interactive prompt to edit your key, then run trust, choose I trust ultimately and finally run save.\ngpg --edit-key B606B038A1A5CE20\ngpg&gt; trust\n# Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys\n# (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)\n#\n#   1 = I don't know or won't say\n#   2 = I do NOT trust\n#   3 = I trust marginally\n#   4 = I trust fully\n#   5 = I trust ultimately\n#   m = back to the main menu\n#\n# Your decision? 5\n# Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust?

Update the git global config to sign commits using your default key with the following two commands, replacing my key id in the first command with your key id.\ngit config --global user.signingkey B606B038A1A5CE20\ngit config --global commit.gpgsign true\n\n\nAdd your key to GitHub\nNow you need to tell GitHub about your new GPG key. Using your key id, ask Keybase to export the public key that matches your private GPG key. Here we’ll pipe it to pbcopy to copy it into the system clipboard.\nkeybase pgp export -q B606B038A1A5CE20 | pbcopy\nThen head over to github.com/settings/keys, click on New GPG key, and paste and add your key into GitHub.\n\n\nCheck your signed commit powers\nAt this point, git will try to sign your commits, but if you’re also using MacOS like me there’s a good chance you’ll run into a problem when you try to commit a file.\n# in a git repo\ntouch test.txt\ngit add test.txt\ngit commit -m \"test signed commits\"\n# error: gpg failed to sign the data\n# fatal: failed to write commit object\nThis error message isn’t entirely helpful, but you can try to sign some random text with gpg to expose the underlying error.\necho \"test\" | gpg --clear-sign\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA256\n\ntest\ngpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device\ngpg: [stdin]: clear-sign failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device\nThe problem in my case is that I have an “Inappropriate ioctl for device”. Take that error to your favorite web search engine and you’ll find a resolution. If you also run into this ioctl error, you need to add the following line to ~/.zshrc (if you’re using Z shell, the latest default on MacOS) or ~/.profile:\nexport GPG_TTY=$(tty)\nSave the file and then close and re-open your terminal window. When you test gpg signing again, you should be prompted with a full-terminal prompt to enter your password.\necho \"test\" | gpg --clear-sign\n\n ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n │ Please enter the passphrase to unlock the OpenPGP secret key: │\n │ \"Garrick Aden-Buie &lt;garrick@adenbuie.com&gt;\"                    │\n │ 4096-bit RSA key, ID B606B038A1A5CE20,                        │\n │ created 2021-09-13.                                           │\n │                                                               │\n │                                                               │\n │ Passphrase: _________________________________________________ │\n │                                                               │\n │         &lt;OK&gt;                                   &lt;Cancel&gt;       │\n └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nEnter your key’s passphrase and, if everything works, you should see a message like this:\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA256\n\ntest\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n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\nYLPCcwzEVSwFrLRRXt5Crcpc/32ZqrfvcLe0G+ACWQYAhktwJnQ=\n=S1iU\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\nAnd if you try to git commit again, it should work!\ngit commit -m \"test signed commits\"\n[main (root-commit) 4c4573f] test signed commits\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 test.txt\nNote that you can be extra sure by looking at the git log with signatures.\ngit log --show-signature\ncommit 4c4573f2fbed44eab6c0f4a08a38a9f8292580cf (HEAD -&gt; main)\ngpg: Signature made Mon Sep 13 09:34:59 2021 EDT\ngpg:                using RSA key 87888BBEBC09E6093A8310F9B606B038A1A5CE20\ngpg: Good signature from \"Garrick Aden-Buie &lt;garrick@adenbuie.com&gt;\" [ultimate]\nAuthor: Garrick Aden-Buie &lt;garrick@adenbuie.com&gt;\nDate:   Mon Sep 13 09:34:59 2021 -0400\n\n    test signed commits\n\n\nInstall a pinentry app\nRemember that console dialog that appeared when we committed our test commit above? Yes, it’s fun and retro, but it isn’t going to work inside RStudio when the IDE runs git commands for you to commit your files.\nIn this step, we’ll install pinentry-mac, a modern method for providing a passphrase for your key, that also integrates with MacOS’s Keychain so you don’t have to enter the passphrase with every commit.\nIf you’re using Windows, you might want to check out the Gpg4win app. On Linux, you may want to use pinentry-gnome3. Finally, you could also configure gpg-agent to cache your passphrase if none of the above options work for you.\nInstalling pinentry-mac is easy with brew:\nbrew install pinentry-mac\nThen we need to configure gpg to use pinentry-mac for its passphrase needs. Add the line below to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:\n# vim ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf\npinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac\nOr you can create the file and add the line in one command:\necho \"pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac\" &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf\nFinally, restart the gpg-agent so that pinentry-mac is used for passphrase entry.\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\nWhen you create your next commit in RStudio, you’ll be prompted with a dialog box to enter your passphrase. If you select the Save in Keychain option, you won’t be prompted again; gpg and git will use the passphrase in your Keychain to sign your commit with the GPG key you created with Keybase!\n\n\n\nThe pinentry-mac dialog window asking for the GPG key passphrase when signing a commit for the first time.\n\n\n\n\nImport your GPG key on another computer\nIf you’d like to use the same GPG key on another computer, first make sure that you have Keybase and gpg installed. Then you can export the existing key (both its public and secret versions) from Keybase into gpg:\nkeybase pgp export -q B606B038A1A5CE20 | gpg --import\nkeybase pgp export -q B606B038A1A5CE20 --secret | gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import\nAgain, you’ll want to tell gpg to trust this key ultimately.\ngpg --edit-key B606B038A1A5CE20\ngpg&gt; trust\n# pick \"5 = I trust ultimately\"\ngpg&gt; save"

If you’ve never used it before, I highly recommend that you stop reading this blog and go watch Sharla Gelfand’s make a reprex… please (or read the slides from the talk).\nYour goal when making a reprex is to come up with a short bit of code that demonstrates the problem you’ve experienced and that is as self-contained as possible.\nTo disentangle your problem from your personal R environment, reprex takes your code, runs it in an isolated environment, and returns a rendered version of your code that’s ready to be copy-pasted into a text box on a number of common websites where R users go for help.\nThis last feature is one of my favorites: the rendered format of a reprex is the perfect way to start crafting a GitHub issue. Typically, I’ll work out the reprex locally, then use the Reprex selection RStudio addin to render the code, and finally jump over to the issues tab of a GitHub repo to paste the code right there.\nHere’s an example reprex from Sharla’s talk. We start with plain R code. reprex renders the R code with additional information about my session and shows me a preview.

You can check out Dean Attali’s post for more details, but the gist is this: any text on a line starting with a special comment format #' becomes markdown.\nThis means we can add text directly to our reprex using these comments!

And usethis has a helpful function to get me right to the issues page:\n\nusethis::browse_github_issues()\n\nBut there’s too much typing. I want reprex to issue, with magic 🧙 ✨.\nSo that’s what we’ll do! In the rest of this post, we’ll use reprex and the rstudioapi package to automatically go from code to GitHub issue. Then we’ll wrap that logic into a function and turn it into an RStudio Addin with my package, shrtcts."

Maybe we have a classic missing argument error and we want to send the issue to gadenbuie/shrtcts (please don’t!).\n\ninput &lt;- \"runif(min = 0, max = 10)\\n\"\nrepo &lt;- \"gadenbuie/shrtcts\"\n\n\nPrepare the issue body\nOur goal is to render the reprex into an issue body and then we’ll put together a URL that takes us to GitHub’s new issue page for the repo with the issue body pre-filled when we get there.\n\nbody &lt;- \"... reprex body goes here ...\"\nurl_new_issue &lt;- glue::glue(\"https://github.com/{repo}/issues/new?body={body}\")\nbrowseURL(url_new_issue)\n\nThe trick here is that you can create a new issue by going to github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/new and we’re sending along the initial body using the query string ?body={body}.\nTo put together the body, we first render the input using reprex::reprex()\n\nbody &lt;- reprex::reprex(input = input, venue = \"gh\", html_preview = TRUE)\n\nwhere we’ve asked for a reprex for GitHub — venue = \"gh\" — and a local HTML preview — html_preview = TRUE. You can adjust the arguments to reprex() to fit your needs, of course.\nUnfortunately, reprex::repex() is only half the work…\n\nbody &lt;- reprex::reprex(input = input, venue = \"gh\", html_preview = TRUE)\nbody\n\n[1] \"``` r\"                                                                           \n[2] \"runif(min = 0, max = 10)\"                                                        \n[3] \"#&gt; Error in runif(min = 0, max = 10): argument \\\"n\\\" is missing, with no default\"\n[4] \"```\"                                                                             \n\n\nNotice that it returns a character vector with one item per line of the rendered reprex. We need to collapse it all into a single string.\n\nbody &lt;- paste(body, collapse = \"\\n\")\n\n\n\n[1] \"``` r\\nrunif(min = 0, max = 10)\\n#&gt; Error in runif(min = 0, max = 10): argument \\\"n\\\" is missing, with no default\\n```\"\n\n\nBut this still won’t fit in a URL because it contains spaces, new lines, and other characters URLs don’t like. So we need to use the base R function URLencode() to turn the body text into something readable only by machines.\n\nbody &lt;- URLencode(body, reserved = TRUE)\n\n\n\n[1] \"%60%60%60%20r%0Arunif%28min%20%3D%200%2C%20max%20%3D%2010%29%0A%23%3E%20Error%20in%20runif%28min%20%3D%200%2C%20max%20%3D%2010%29%3A%20argument%20%22n%22%20is%20missing%2C%20with%20no%20default%0A%60%60%60\"\n\n\nFinally, we can make our new issue URL.\n\nurl_new_issue &lt;- glue::glue(\"https://github.com/{repo}/issues/new?body={body}\")\nurl_new_issue\n\nhttps://github.com/gadenbuie/shrtcts/issues/new?body=%60%60%60%20r%0Arunif%28min%20%3D%200%2C%20max%20%3D%2010%29%0A%23%3E%20Error%20in%20runif%28min%20%3D%200%2C%20max%20%3D%2010%29%3A%20argument%20%22n%22%20is%20missing%2C%20with%20no%20default%0A%60%60%60\n\n\nI didn’t make the link clickable, but if you were to follow it, you’d find a brand new issue page ready for you.\n\n\n\nA new GitHub issue page with our reprex as the issue body\n\n\n\n\nGrab the input from the user\nOf course, we don’t want to have to define input manualy every time we run this function. Instead, we’d rather get the input code from\n\nthe current selection in RStudio\nor the clipboard if nothing is selected\n\nTo make things easy, we’ll ignore the fact that RStudio has a multiple cursors feature, and we’ll just get the first selection of code. We’ll use the getSourceEditorContext() to get the currently open text file, then we can grab the text from the first selection in that editor window.\n\nctx &lt;- rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()\nselection &lt;- ctx$selection[[1]]$text\n\nIf nothing is selected, selection will be an empty string, \"\", in which case we’d prefer to leave input as NULL so that reprex() will look in the clipboard for our input. We also need to make sure that input is a character vector so that reprex() knows that input contains the reprex code and not a path to a file.\n\ninput &lt;- if (nzchar(selection)) {\n  c(strsplit(selection, \"\\n\")[[1]], \"\")\n}\n\nWe’ll be wrapping this up in a function where input might be provided by the user, so we’ll only want to check for a selection if input is NULL.\n\nif (is.null(input)) {\n  ctx &lt;- rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()\n  selection &lt;- ctx$selection[[1]]$text\n  input &lt;- if (nzchar(selection)) {\n    c(strsplit(selection, \"\\n\")[[1]], \"\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nPick the repository\nOften, I’ll be working in the repository where I want to create the issue. usethis does a great job guessing the repository from the information in a local copy of the repo. Rather than spending forever writing our own version, let’s just reach into usethis with ::: to call target_repo_spec().\nThe function returns the current repo in the form \"owner/repo\", but since it isn’t designed to be user-facing it throws an unusual error when called from outside a git repository. We can soften this edge by catching the error with tryCatch() and replacing the error with a NULL value.\n\nrepo_guess &lt;- tryCatch(\n  usethis:::target_repo_spec(\"source\", FALSE),\n  error = function(err) NULL\n)\n\nOf course, maybe I’ll want to create a reprex in another repository that isn’t the one I’m currently working in. So we can follow up with a prompt asking for the repo, using our guess from usethis. The prompt is created with the showPrompt() function from rstudioapi.\n\nrepo &lt;- rstudioapi::showPrompt(\n  title = \"Which repository?\",\n  message = \"Where should we create the issue? (owner/repo)\",\n  default = repo_guess\n)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the function we’re putting together will also take a repo argument that might be provided when we call it. In that case, we’d wouldn’t need to guess or ask for a repo.\n\nif (is.null(repo)) {\n  repo_guess &lt;- tryCatch(\n    usethis:::target_repo_spec(\"source\", FALSE),\n    error = function(err) NULL\n  )\n\n  repo &lt;- rstudioapi::showPrompt(\n    title = \"Which repository?\",\n    message = \"Where should we create the issue? (owner/repo)\",\n    default = repo_guess\n  )\n}"

    "text": "Make it a shortcut\nThe last step in our process is to make it easy to run this code in RStudio, ideally as an RStudio addin that we can activate from the addins menu or the command palette.\nThis is the exact goal of the shrtcts package: shrtcts lets you turn any function into an RStudio addin.\n\nSet up shrtcts\nIf you’ve never used shrtcts before, you need to do two things to get started. First, install the package, from my R-universe or from GitHub.\n\n\nR-universe\n\n# Add my universe to your list of repos\noptions(repos = c(\n  gadenbuie = \"https://gadenbuie.r-universe.dev\",\n  getOption(\"repos\")\n))\n\ninstall.package(\"shrtcts\")\n\n\n\nGitHub\n\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\n\nremotes::install_github(\"gadenbuie/shrtcts\")\n\n\n\nThe next thing to do is to open a .shrtcts.R file where we’ll add our new shortcut. This is easy to do with shrtcts::edit_shortcuts(), which will offer to create the .shrtcts.R file if it doesn’t exit.\n\nshrtcts::edit_shortcuts()\n\nWould you like to create a new shrtcts file at\n'~/Library/Application Support/shrtcts/.shrtcts.R' (Yes/no/cancel) yes\n\n\nCreating a shortcut function\nWe’ll write R functions in the .shrtcts.R file and turn them into RStudio addins by annotating those functions with roxygen-style comments.\nWe start with a skeleton of a function that takes two arguments: input and repo, neither of which are required. Inside the function, we’ll do all the steps from above, which we’ll fill in in a second.\n\ncreate_issue_from_reprex &lt;- function(input = NULL, repo = NULL) {\n  # guess or ask for repo\n  # get current selection, if available\n  # render reprex\n  # compose new issue URL\n  # go to the new issue page!\n}\n\nOur next step is to turn this function into a shortcut. Using roxygen2 documentation syntax, we give the function a title and description — these will be used as the title and description of the shortcut. We can also use the @shortcut tag to set a keyboard shortcut (if you want), and the @interactive tag lets shortcuts know that the addin should be run interactively rather than in the background.\n\n#' Create issue from reprex\n#'\n#' Creates an issue from the selected or copied reprex.\n#'\n#' @shortcut Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+R\n#' @interactive\ncreate_issue_from_reprex &lt;- function(input = NULL, repo = NULL) {\n  # guess or ask for repo\n  # get current selection, if available\n  # render reprex\n  # compose new issue URL\n  # go to the new issue page!\n}\n\nFinally, we can replace our placeholder comments with all of the code we wrote above.\n\n#' Create issue from reprex\n#'\n#' Creates an issue from the selected or copied reprex.\n#'\n#' @shortcut Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+R\n#' @interactive\ncreate_issue_from_reprex &lt;- function(input = NULL, repo = NULL) {\n  if (is.null(repo)) {\n    repo_guess &lt;- tryCatch(\n      usethis:::target_repo_spec(\"source\", FALSE),\n      error = function(err) NULL\n    )\n  \n    repo &lt;- rstudioapi::showPrompt(\n      title = \"Which repository?\",\n      message = \"Where should we create the issue? (owner/repo)\",\n      default = repo_guess\n    )\n  }\n\n  if (is.null(input)) {\n    ctx &lt;- rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()\n    selection &lt;- ctx$selection[[1]]$text\n    input &lt;- if (nzchar(selection)) {\n      c(strsplit(selection, \"\\n\")[[1]], \"\")\n    }\n  }\n\n  body &lt;- reprex::reprex(input = input, venue = \"gh\", html_preview = TRUE)\n  body &lt;- paste(body, collapse = \"\\n\")\n  body &lt;- URLencode(body, reserved = TRUE)\n  url_new_issue &lt;- glue::glue(\"https://github.com/{repo}/issues/new?body={body}\")\n  browseURL(url_new_issue)\n  invisible(url_new_issue)\n}\n\nLoad your shortcuts and restart your R session to activate the addin and you’ll be ready to jump from reprex to GitHub issue in no time!\n\nshrtcts::add_rstudio_shortcuts(set_keyboard_shortcuts = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nThe reprex to GitHub issue shortcut in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new GitHub issue page with our reprex as the issue body"

The page is loaded in an iframe, which makes deep-linking hard: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\n\n03:39pmI picked the signed 3.6.3 binary but I still had to go through macOS security steps.

    "text": "PDF slides and the case of the missing images\nBut PDF slides come with a few challenges of their own, most of which are related to the fact that you’re essentially using the browser’s printing features to print your slides to PDF.\nThe one that I’ve seen most often in PDFs is that images that happily render in the browser can suddenly disappear from the PDF version of the slides. Here’s how I described the problem in an issue in renderthis:\n\nChrome’s printing algorithm…excludes images that extend beyond the visible margin from printing. I’m sure [there’s a reason for this that] makes sense for general webpage printing, but it does cause problems for slides.\nIt can be hard to tell visually if the plot extends past the margins of the slide because the actual image may include empty space that you can’t see.\n\nOften plots and other images include some empty space at the edges that can overflow the slide in a non-obvious way. The trick I tend to use is to add a red outline around all the images in the slides during development (or just before publishing the slides):\nimg, svg {\n  outline: 1px solid red;\n}"

    "section": "Automate it!",
    "text": "Automate it!\nI absolutely love taking an annoying manual process and turning it into runnable, repeatable code. Automate all the things!\nWe can automate slide-image overflow with these 4 steps:\n\nFire up headless Chrome and load the slides in the virtual, remote-controllable browser.\nDetermine the natural desired size of the slides (in pixels) and then set the virtual browser window to this size. This isn’t strictly necessary, but it makes the math much easier later on, so it’s worth it.\nMake all of slides visible at once. Otherwise, remark (the JavaScript library that powers the slides) hides all of the slides except the current slide. Elements that are hidden from the browser don’t have a size, ruining our ability to detect overflow.\nFinally, find all of the images in the slides and check if any escape the slide (browser window) boundaries.\n\n\nWith chromote\nNow we get to the fun part. First we need to start up chromote and initialize a new browser session.\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nchrome &lt;- ChromoteSession$new()\n\nI’ve stored the example slide deck in a folder called example-slide, and I’ve already rendered it from index.Rmd to index.html. To load the file in Chrome, we need the full path to the file, prefixed with file://, e.g. file:///Users/garrick/.../example-slide/index.html.\n\nslide_path &lt;- file.path(\"example-slide\", \"index.html\")\nslide_path_uri &lt;- file.path(\"file:/\", normalizePath(slide_path))\n\nNow we can load the slides in Chrome. I’m using a small trick here to make sure that the R session waits for the browser to load the page. The trick is to request the Page.loadEventFired event via chromote asynchronously (wait_ = FALSE), then load the page, after which the we block the R session until the page load event fires.\n\npl &lt;- chrome$Page$loadEventFired(wait_ = FALSE)\nchrome$Page$navigate(slide_path_uri, wait_ = FALSE)\n#&gt; &lt;Promise [pending]&gt;\n\n# Block until the page load event fires\nchrome$wait_for(pl)\n#&gt; $timestamp\n#&gt; [1] 195025.8\n\nThat’s not something you usually have to do with chromote when you’re interacting with pages on the web (because those take long enough to load), but local pages load very quickly, sometimes faster than the R expressions are evaluated. (In other words, if you execute the navigate command and then wait for page load event, you might miss it.)\n\n\nMatch window size to slide size\nNow that we have our slides loaded in the headless browser, we need to figure out what size they are. remark uses some rather random pixels values based on the specified slide ratio, so the easiest thing to do is find the first visible slide and figure out what size remark used.\nHere’s a small JavaScript function that will do that for us:\n\nfunction get_slide_size() {\n  // Find the first visible slide in the deck\n  const visible_slide = document\n    .querySelector('.remark-visible .remark-slide-scaler')\n\n  // and inspect it's width and height\n  // knowing that remark will set these values\n  const {width, height} = visible_slide.style\n\n  return {\n    width: parseInt(width),\n    height: parseInt(height)\n  }\n}\n\nWe the use the $Runtime$evaluate() methods of the chromote object to run the JavaScript function definition, by passing the JS code as a string2.\n\n\nLoading the function in the browser via chromote\nchrome$Runtime$evaluate(\"\nfunction get_slide_size() {\n  // Find the first visible slide in the deck\n  const visible_slide = document\n    .querySelector('.remark-visible .remark-slide-scaler')\n\n  // and inspect it's width and height\n  // knowing that remark will set these values\n  const {width, height} = visible_slide.style\n\n  return {\n    width: parseInt(width),\n    height: parseInt(height)\n  }\n}\n\")\n\n\nNow that we’ve loaded the function in the browser, we can call it to get the size of the slides. Here we again use $Runtime$evaluate(), but I’ve added returnByValue = TRUE to the call to get the result of the JS expression back in R.\n\nslide_size &lt;-\n  chrome$Runtime$evaluate(\n    \"get_slide_size()\",\n    wait_ = TRUE,\n    returnByValue = TRUE\n  )\n\n# Extract the result we want from Chrome's response\nslide_size &lt;- slide_size$result$value\nslide_size\n#&gt; $width\n#&gt; [1] 908\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $height\n#&gt; [1] 681\n\nWith the slide size in hand, we can set the size of the virtual browser window using the $Emulation$setVisibleSize() method.\n\nchrome$Emulation$setVisibleSize(\n  height = slide_size$height,\n  width = slide_size$width\n)\n\nIf you wanted to be certain everything is set up correctly, you could call chrome$view() now and see the slides your browser’s seeing.\n\n\n\nThe headless Chrome preview of the slides in a Chrome window.\n\n\n\n\nMake all slides visible\nWith our slides loaded in the browser, we need to make them all visible. This trick involves finding all of the slides in the deck – using the .remark-slides-area .remark-slide-container selector – and then add the remark-visible class to each slide. This is the class that remark toggles to show and hide the slides when you move through them.\n\ndocument\n  .querySelectorAll('.remark-slides-area .remark-slide-container')\n  .forEach(slide =&gt; slide.classList.add('remark-visible'))\n\n\n\nDetect clipped elements\nDetecting if an element is clipped is easy now that we’ve made all the slides visible and set the browser window to match the slide size exactly.\nThe core idea in this function is to use the getBoundingClientRect() method to get the position of the element relative to the browser window. If any side of the element is outside of the window, then the element is clipped.\n\nfunction is_element_clipped(el) {\n  const { top, left, bottom, right  } = el.getBoundingClientRect()\n  return top &lt; 0 ||\n    left &lt; 0 ||\n    right &gt; window.innerWidth ||\n    bottom &gt; window.innerHeight\n}\n\nIf we hadn’t resized the virtual browser window to match the slide size, then we would have to do figure out the slide’s size and the element’s relative position within it to determine if the element is clipped.\nIf we’ve found a clipped element, we can extract some useful information about it that we’ll use in R to learn about our problematic images. I also threw in a console.log() element so that, you if were to use this code in a head-full browser, you’d get a nice console message about the clipped image.\n\nfunction clipped_img_info(el) {\n    // If you're looking at the slides in the browser,\n    // this will logged the clipped images in the console.\n    console.log(\"clipped image\", el)\n\n    return {\n      img_tag: el.tagName,\n      img_src: /^data:/.test(el.src) ? el.src.slice(0, 32) : el.src,\n      img_class: el.classList.toString(),\n      slide_heading: el.closest('.remark-slide')\n        .querySelector('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6')\n        ?.innerText,\n      slide_text: el.closest('.remark-slide').innerText,\n    }\n  }\n\nNow we’re at the best part. We use .querySelectorAll() to find all images (or SVGs) in our slides, filter them to include only those that are clipped, and then extract the information we need about the clipped images.\n\ndocument\n  .querySelectorAll(\n    '.remark-slides-area .remark-slide :is(img, svg)'\n  )\n  .filter(is_element_clipped)\n  .map(clipped_img_info)\n\n\n\nFind all the clipped images\nTo make life a little easier, I wrote all of the above JavaScript code into a file called find-bad-images.js. If you want, you can download that file and use it directly. Here, I’ll read the contents and pass the string of JavaScript to chromote to get the results.\n\nbad_images &lt;-\n  chrome$Runtime$evaluate(\n    paste(readLines(\"find-bad-images.js\"), collapse = \"\\n\"),\n    wait_ = TRUE,\n    returnByValue = TRUE\n  )\n\nWith a little bit of data reshaping, we’ve got a nice table of all the images we need to fix in our slides.\n\nbad_images$result$value |&gt;\n  purrr::map_dfr(~ .) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(img_src = basename(img_src))\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 5\n#&gt;   img_tag img_src    img_class   slide_heading              slide_text          \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;chr&gt;               \n#&gt; 1 IMG     plot-1.png \"\"          Slide with clipped plot    \"Slide with clipped…\n#&gt; 2 IMG     plot-1.png \"\"          Absolutely positioned plot \"Absolutely positio…\n#&gt; 3 svg     &lt;NA&gt;       \"bi bi-bug\" SVG too big!               \"SVG too big!\\n4 / …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe headless Chrome preview of the slides in a Chrome window."

    "section": "Promote attributes to list items",
    "text": "Promote attributes to list items\nI want to extract these attributes and promote them to list-level named entries. To do this I’ll use a recursive function, meaning a function that calls itself. When approaching writing a recursive function, it’s useful to think of the base case — when we have or can get the answer that we’re looking for — and the recursion case — or when we need to move further down the tree by calling the function again on a smaller unit.\n\nBase case\nThe base case of the recursive function is when we have an empty list that has attributes. In that case, we just return the attributes. A good example of the base case from our example XML is the list_xml[[1]][[1]][[1]] we see above.\n\nattributes(list_xml[[1]][[1]][[1]])\n\n$empno\n[1] \"7369\"\n\n$ename\n[1] \"SMITH\"\n\n$job\n[1] \"CLERK\"\n\n$hiredate\n[1] \"17-DEC-1980\"\n\n\n\n\nRecursive case\nIf, on the other hand, we find that we have a list that contains both items and attributes we do three things. First, we keep a copy of the attributes of the list at the current level that we’ll use later. Second, we look inside each of the items in the list we currently have to see if we can promote their attributes. This triggers the recursion, so this function will keep calling itself on smaller and smaller units until eventually it reaches a list with no items and only attributes. At that point, it returns the attributes as a list.\nThe third and final step is to take the attribute list at the original level and concatenate the list returned from the lower level.\nWhen thinking about programming the recusive case, I usually try to think about one step above the base case. That is, what would I do if I’m one level above the base case. For this, we can use list_xml[[1]][[1]], and, in essence, we want to perform this action:\n\nthis_attr &lt;- attributes(list_xml[[1]][[1]])\nlower_level &lt;- purrr::map(list_xml[[1]][[1]], attributes)\nstr(lower_level)\n\nList of 5\n $ employee:List of 4\n  ..$ empno   : chr \"7369\"\n  ..$ ename   : chr \"SMITH\"\n  ..$ job     : chr \"CLERK\"\n  ..$ hiredate: chr \"17-DEC-1980\"\n $ employee:List of 4\n  ..$ empno   : chr \"7499\"\n  ..$ ename   : chr \"ALLEN\"\n  ..$ job     : chr \"SALESMAN\"\n  ..$ hiredate: chr \"20-FEB-1981\"\n $ employee:List of 4\n  ..$ empno   : chr \"7521\"\n  ..$ ename   : chr \"WARD\"\n  ..$ job     : chr \"SALESMAN\"\n  ..$ hiredate: chr \"22-FEB-1981\"\n $ employee:List of 4\n  ..$ empno   : chr \"7566\"\n  ..$ ename   : chr \"JONES\"\n  ..$ job     : chr \"MANAGER\"\n  ..$ hiredate: chr \"02-APR-1981\"\n $ employee:List of 4\n  ..$ empno   : chr \"7654\"\n  ..$ ename   : chr \"MARTIN\"\n  ..$ job     : chr \"SALESMAN\"\n  ..$ hiredate: chr \"28-SEP-1981\"\n\nstr(c(this_attr, lower_level), max.level = 1)\n\nList of 8\n $ names   : chr [1:5] \"employee\" \"employee\" \"employee\" \"employee\" ...\n $ company : chr \"MacroSoft\"\n $ division: chr \"Sales\"\n $ employee:List of 4\n $ employee:List of 4\n $ employee:List of 4\n $ employee:List of 4\n $ employee:List of 4"

This is because R uses named attributes to keep track of things like \"names\", \"class\", \"dimnames\" etc. If the XML node has an attribute called names=\"foo\", xml2 will store that attribute-value pair as .names. I don’t mind having .names entries in my lists (I can take care of that downstream), but I don’t want to keep attributes namednames or class etc., because those are reserved for special R functionality.\nHere’s a small function that removes reserved R attributes from the attributes list.\n\nremove_reserved &lt;- function(this_attr) {\n  reserved_attr &lt;- c(\"class\", \"comment\", \"dim\", \"dimnames\", \"names\", \"row.names\", \"tsp\")\n  if (!any(reserved_attr %in% names(this_attr))) {\n    return(this_attr)\n  }\n  for (reserved in reserved_attr) {\n    if (!is.null(this_attr[[reserved]])) this_attr[[reserved]] &lt;- NULL\n  }\n  this_attr\n}\n\nFinally, we can combine everything in a recursive function I’ll call promote_attr().\n\npromote_attr &lt;- function(ll) {\n  this_attr &lt;- attributes(ll)\n  this_attr &lt;- remove_reserved(this_attr)\n  if (length(ll)) {\n    # recursive case\n    c(this_attr, purrr::map(ll, promote_attr))\n  } else {\n    # base case (no sub-items)\n    this_attr\n  }\n}\n\nQuick aside: this function makes very strong assumptions that every item in the list we’re recursing over is also a list, all the way down. In this example processing a list derived from an XML document, it’s a reasonable assumption, but one that we should check. For other lists of mixed types, a whole lot more type checking will be required."

For example, there are 4 variations of palevioletred that I’m using in the following plot for each of 4 years of Austin housing sales data.\n\ng_austin_housing +\n  ## A basic ggplot of home sale prices in Austin\n  ## over 4 years, using the ggplot2::txhousing data\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"palevioletred1\",\n      \"palevioletred2\",\n      \"palevioletred3\",\n      \"palevioletred4\",\n    )\n  )"

    "text": "Utility CSS\nIf you’re used to working with R’s color names, they unfortunately don’t align with HTML’s named colors, which means that you can’t write a CSS rule like\n\nh3.plot-title {\n  color: palevioletred1;\n}\n\nbecause palevioletred1 isn’t a valid HTML color. This causes problems if you use an R color name in a function that write CSS files.\nI’ve also been interested lately in utility CSS frameworks, like Tailwinds CSS and Tachyons. What’s awesome about these frameworks is that they use small, single-purpose CSS classes — called utility classes — that can be flexibly applied to your HTML elements. I do most, if not all, of my writing in some variant of markdown, and utility classes let me build small components or slightly adjust appearances without having to write a whole lot of CSS.\nTailwinds looks amazing, but it requires a moderately complicated build setup, so I’ve settled on using Tachyons. In particular, it integrates nicely with xaringan and other R Markdown outputs where a complete CSS framework is in use (like R Markdown with bootstrap). For that reason, I’ve included it in xaringanExtra, and you can add Tachyons to any R Markdown document with xaringanExtra::use_tachyons().\nHere’s an example of what you can do with utility CSS. If I want to create a simple box with…\n\na border\n\non all sides (.ba)\nthat’s gray (.b--gray)\nwith a medium line width (.bw2),\n\nmedium exterior margin (.ma2),\nlarge interior padding (.pa4),\nand a box shadow (.shadow-1)\n\n…I can use those classes on the same element. Here are four markdown syntax variations that use those classes.\n\n\n\nxaringan\n\n.b--gray.ba.bw2.ma2.pa4.shadow-1[\nTalent is a pursued interest.\nAnything that you're willing to practice, you can do.\n\n—Bob Ross\n]\n\n\n\nR Markdown\n\n::: {.b--gray .ba .bw2 .ma2 .pa4 .shadow-1}\nTalent is a pursued interest.\nAnything that you're willing to practice, you can do.\n\n—Bob Ross\n:::\n\n\n\nHTML\n\n&lt;div class=\"b--gray ba bw2 ma2 pa4 shadow-1\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Talent is a pursued interest.\nAnything that you're willing to practice, you can do.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;—Bob Ross&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\nhtmltools (R)\n\nhtmltools::div(\n  class = \"b--gray ba bw2 ma2 pa4 shadow-1\",\n  htmltools::p(\n    \"Talent is a pursued interest.\",\n    \"Anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.\",\n  ),\n  htmltools::p(\"—Bob Ross\")\n)\n\n\n\nCSS\n\nNote: this isn’t the exact CSS from Tachyons, but it’s very similar.\n\n.b--gray {\n  border-color: #888888;\n}\n.ba {\n  border-style: solid;\n}\n.bw2 {\n  border-width: .25em;\n}\n.ma2 {\n  margin: 1.5em;\n}\n.pa4 {\n  padding: 2em;\n}\n.shadow-1 {\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nTalent is a pursued interest.

A lot of the package’s functions target R package maintainers, but there’s a small cluster of functions that are life changing for anyone who uses git or collaborates with others via GitHub1.\nThese pull request helpers all start with the pr_ prefix, but I initially found them a little confusing to use since they’re each designed to be called in a specific context — for example, when you have local work that isn’t associated with a PR or when a PR exists but you don’t have the work locally on your computer.\nOnce I wrapped my head around the functions, though, using them has utterly transformed my day-to-day workflow. I can move in and out of collaborative work seamlessly. The flow chart above is my personal mental model of this cluster of functions and I hope it helps you make sense of them, too.\nThere are other great resources available in the usethis documentation. Beyond the function documentation, there’s also the great Pull request helpers article. That article walks through a pull request from the perspective of a contributor and a package maintainer.\nIn this blog post, however, you get to play both roles and choose your own adventure!"

Go for a walk, read something engaging, talk to a friend, take a shower.\nAnd now you’re back with fresh eyes, more energy, and a full cup of coffee. This time, things go better! You fall easily into a flow and start writing some code. As you go, you periodically pause to stage files with gert::git_add() or to commit batches of changes with gert::git_commit().\nAfter a bit you surprise yourself when you realize that the thing you couldn’t figure out when you were tired yesterday you’ve knocked out in an hour.\n\nDecision time: Happy with your progress, you’re ready update the PR with your latest changes.\n\n\n\nCollaborate with someone else\nThis is exciting!

Since you’re working with someone else, you remember to write good commit messages, but since you’re having fun you also use gitmoji to give each commit a good emoji.\nIt’s a lot later than you expect when you start wrapping up. That’s okay, @wileycoyote is going to be stoked to see what you’ve been working on!\n\nDecision time: Go head and update the PR with your latest changes.\n\n\n\nTake a snapshot of your work\nIf you like it then you shoulda made a git commit.\nThere are two parts to taking a snapshot of your code. And really, it’s less like taking a picture and more like sending yourself an email with a copy of your files.\nFirst, you’ll pick the files that you want to add to the snapshot (or commit). You can do this in the R console using git_add() from the gert package. Give the function a vector with the paths to the files you changed.\n\ngert::git_add(c(\"R/atom_arranger.R\", \"man/atom_arranger.Rd\"))\n\nIn git-speak, git_add() adds the changes in the listed files to a staging area. Running this command is like dragging a file into the email you’re writing. We haven’t officially sent that email yet, but we have a copy ready to go. By the way, you can still make more changes to the file knowing that there’s a temporary copy in that email draft in case anything goes wrong.\nThen, once all the files you want to commit have been added, you commit the changes. In our email metaphor, committing is a lot like pressing send on the email.\nAnd just like an email, the commit includes a message where you can describe the updates you made to the files in the email (commit).\nFor this step you can use git_commit() (also from the gert package) which takes the commit message as a parameter. Think of this message like the subject of an email to your future self.\n\ngert::git_commit(\"Add an example to ?atom_arranger()\")\n\nP.S.

There are three methods that I’ve used that each work well and produce relatively similar results:\n\nPrint the slides from a browser. Typically this works best in Chrome.\nUse xaringan::decktape() to virtually print the slides to PDF. This requires docker or an installed version of the decktape.js utility.\nUse pagedown::chrome_print(). This is similar to the first option, but uses a headless version of Chrome to do the printing behind the scenes.\n\nThese methods all work well but have one significant drawback: they don’t work well with xaringanExtra’s panelsets. The problem with the panelsets is that they essentially add “within-slide” slides. All of the panels are contained in a single slide, so when printed, only the first panel in the panelset is shown."

    "text": "The Idea\nThe solution is easy but took me a bit of fiddling to figure out: we use chromote to control our own headless version of Chrome. Then we ask a programmatic monkey to push the → button repeatedly, once per second(-ish), to advance through the slides, printing each slide to its own PDF.\nOnce all the slides are printed, we ask our monkey assistant to please staple the slides together into one (big) PDF file. All of this happens inside a headless Chrome browser controlled by chromote.\nThat’s it! And okay, the monkey assistant is actually a little bit of JavaScript that mashes a virtual right arrow key. And the stapler is actually the fantastic pdftools package.\nOh, and headless isn’t as spooky as it sounds. Basically it’s Chrome without the chrome. In other words, it’s a version of Chrome that runs as a command line utility and doesn’t have a user interface that you can click around in. Instead, you communicate with the browser by sending it commands, all of which are made easier by chromote."

    "text": "How Popular are Letters Used Anywhere in Baby Names\n\nLetters in Baby Names\nTo answer the first question, I needed to first establish what letters are used in a name, regardless of the letter’s position in the name, and not counting duplicates. Rather than repeatedly calculate this information for every year, sex, and name pair in babynames, I used distinct() from dplyr to obtain the list of unique names.\n\nbabynames_and_letters &lt;-\n  babynames %&gt;%\n  distinct(name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(letter = strsplit(tolower(name), character())) %&gt;%\n  # strsplit() returns a list for each name,\n  # so 'letter' is a list-column that can be converted to a\n  # normal column with unnest()\n  unnest(letter) %&gt;%\n  # count each letter once\n  distinct()\n\nbabynames_and_letters %&gt;%\n  filter(name == \"Garrick\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  name    letter\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Garrick g     \n2 Garrick a     \n3 Garrick r     \n4 Garrick i     \n5 Garrick c     \n6 Garrick k     \n\n\nThen I joined babynames with the babynames_and_letters table to get the sum of the proportions of the population (by year and sex) that have each letter in their name.\n\nbabynames_containing &lt;-\n  left_join(babynames, babynames_and_letters, by = \"name\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(letter, year, sex) %&gt;%\n  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 1900) %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = \"Male\", F = \"Female\"))\n\nbabynames_containing %&gt;%\n  filter(letter == \"g\") %&gt;%\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  letter  year sex      prop\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 g       1900 Female 0.0800\n2 g       1900 Male   0.0632\n3 g       1901 Female 0.0827\n4 g       1901 Male   0.0615\n5 g       1902 Female 0.0831\n6 g       1902 Male   0.0618\n\n\n\n\nPlot and Animate\nAt this point, my typical gganimate workflow is to first create a static ggplot2 plot as a sanity check for the animation. If the static plot works with facet_wrap(~ state_column), then using transition_state(state_column) is likely to work well (although you may need to filter the data to preview only a few states). In this case, I used year as the state column.\nI generally try to structure my ggplot2 code in a consistent way (future blog post?) so I prefer having the gganimate specific parts at the end. I also directly called gganimate::animate() so that I could control specific parameters of the output, namely the number of frames and the size of the image. The default number of frames is 100 but I’m visualizing 117 years and gganimate will complain (i.e. throw an error) if there aren’t enough frames to cover the number of states.\n\nga_pop_letter &lt;-\n  ggplot(babynames_containing) +\n  aes(letter, prop, fill = sex) +\n  geom_col(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 10),\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = sex_colors) +\n  labs(\n    x        = NULL,\n    y        = \"Percent of Population\",\n    fill     = NULL,\n    title    = \"How many babies have the letter ____ in their name?\",\n    subtitle = \"{closest_state}\",\n    caption  = caption_text\n  ) +\n  base_theme +\n  ease_aes(\"linear\") +\n  transition_states(\n    year, transition_length = 1, state_length = 0, wrap = FALSE\n  )\n\nga_pop_letter_animated &lt;- animate(\n  ga_pop_letter,\n  nframes = 117*2+10,\n  end_pause = 10,\n  width = 1024,\n  height = 512\n)\n\nThe resulting animation, below, shows the proportion of babies given a name containing (at least one of) each letter of the alphabet since 1900."

You can still see the change in the use of N as a final letter in the names given to baby boys, as he described, but you also see the changes in female names as well.\n\nHere’s the code I used to produce the plot above.\n\ngb_last &lt;-\n  babynames_first_last %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 1900) %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = \"Male\", F = \"Female\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, sex, last_letter) %&gt;%\n  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(last_letter, prop, fill = sex) +\n  geom_col(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 5),\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = sex_colors) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Percent of Population\",\n    fill = NULL,\n    title = \"How many baby names end with the letter ____?\",\n    subtitle = \"{closest_state}\",\n    caption = caption_text\n  ) +\n  base_theme +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.9)) +\n  ease_aes(\"linear\") +\n  transition_states(\n    year,\n    transition_length = 1,\n    state_length = 0, wrap = FALSE\n  )\n\ngb_last_animated &lt;- animate(\n  gb_last,\n  nframes = 117*2+10,\n  end_pause = 10,\n  width = 1024, height = 512\n)\n\nThen I also created a similar visualization for the starting letters of baby’s names.\n\nAnd here’s the code to create the above animation.\n\ngb_first &lt;-\n  babynames_first_last %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 1900) %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = \"Male\", F = \"Female\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, sex, first_letter) %&gt;%\n  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(first_letter, prop, fill = sex) +\n  geom_col(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 5),\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = sex_colors) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Percent of Population\",\n    fill = NULL,\n    title = \"How many baby names start with the letter ____?\",\n    subtitle = \"{closest_state}\",\n    caption = caption_text\n  ) +\n  base_theme +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.9)) +\n  ease_aes(\"linear\") +\n  transition_states(\n    year,\n    transition_length = 1,\n    state_length = 0,\n    wrap = FALSE\n  )\n\ngb_first_animated &lt;- animate(\n  gb_first,\n  nframes = 117*2+10,\n  end_pause = 10,\n  width = 1024, height = 512\n)\n\n\n\nStatic\nI’ll admit, I think the animated plots are cool, but they also make it hard to reason about overall trends. You have to watch the animation loop over and over, trying to watch one letter or one sex specifically. I feel like I’m seeing the movement but missing the picture.\nI thought it would be interesting to compare the animated plots with line charts showing the same information, so I swapped gganimate’s transition_state(year) for ggplot2’s facet_wrap(~ letter).\nI somewhat like these plots more than their animated versions. I get the sense that I’m seeing a fuller picture (or more easy-to-compare picture) of the overall trends in starting and ending letters of baby names.\n\n\nHere’s the code to produce the static image of the trends in the last letter of baby names.\n\nbabynames_first_last %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 1900) %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = \"Male\", F = \"Female\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, sex, last_letter) %&gt;%\n  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(last_letter = toupper(last_letter)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(year, prop) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = tibble(\n      last_letter = LETTERS,\n      x = 1900+117/2,\n      prop = 0\n    ),\n    aes(label = last_letter, x = x),\n    size = rel(15),\n    vjust = -0.12,\n    color = \"grey75\",\n    family = \"PT Sans\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = sex)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ last_letter) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(5),\n    breaks = c(0, 0.3)\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1900, 2000)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = sex_colors) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Proportion of Population\",\n    title = \"How many babies have names ending with the letter ____?\",\n    caption = caption_text,\n    color = NULL\n  ) +\n  base_theme +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"plain\"),\n    legend.position = c(0.7, 0.025),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\nAnd here is the code to produce the plot of trends in the first letter of baby names.\n\nbabynames_first_last %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 1900) %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex = recode(sex, M = \"Male\", F = \"Female\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, sex, first_letter) %&gt;%\n  summarize(prop = sum(prop)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(first_letter = toupper(first_letter)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(year, prop) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = tibble(\n      first_letter = LETTERS,\n      x = 1900+117/2,\n      prop = 0\n    ),\n    aes(label = first_letter, x = x),\n    size = rel(15),\n    vjust = -0.2,\n    color = \"grey75\",\n    family = \"PT Sans\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = sex)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ first_letter) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(5),\n    breaks = c(0, 0.2)\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1900, 2000)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = sex_colors) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Proportion of Population\",\n    title = \"How many babies have names starting with the letter ____?\",\n    caption = caption_text,\n    color = NULL\n  ) +\n  base_theme +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"plain\"),\n    legend.position = c(0.7, 0.025),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading!

What I like most are the subtle visual clues that link code inputs and outputs by keeping both source and output inside the same box. I have a plan to do something similar on this blog using custom source and output classes via the class.output and class.source chunk options.\nBut I quickly discovered that the class.output class is only applied to standard code output, and not the “side effect” chunk outputs, such as messages, warnings and errors.\nI opened an issue in knitr and, amazingly, three days later my wishes were granted: You can now use the chunk options class.message, class.warning, and class.error to customize the CSS class of outputs of each type.\nThe new feature will be available in version 1.22 when it makes it to CRAN, or now from GitHub.\nUsing this feature, you can get nicely formatted chunk outputs.

See it in action: https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#29\nUpdate: I went ahead and submitted a PR with this new feature to xaringan: https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/pull/103\nHave you met xaringan yet? It’s yet another fantastic package from Yihui Xie that makes it easy to blend R code and text into presentations that look great on the web, in print and on screens. Check out the demo/intro slides!\nIt’s built on remark.js with few extra features, and one of my favorite features is the ability to highlight specific lines of code. In presentations, this draws attention to the most important part of the code demonstration, but doesn’t break the reproducibility.\n\n\n\nThe line highlighting example from the xaringan demo slides.\n\n\nBasically, if you wrap a line in your code with {..code..}, that line will be highlighted in the slides. This works because {x} is a valid expression in R that just returns x, so the source code in the chunk runs correctly and an output hook cleans up the line.\nI love the feature, but it feels a little clunky in practice. When you add the braces into your code, you can’t rely on RStudio’s auto-indenter to get the code alignment right. The alignment in the chunk is fine after compiling, with the second line highlighted, but it looks a little odd in the source code.\n```{r} \npaste(\"This looks\",\n     {{\"a little odd\"}},\n      \"but it's right\")\n```\nAlso, the braces only work when wrapped around expressions – like {\"a little odd\"} – so you have to pick out the part of the line that is a valid R expression.\n```{r} \n{{paste(}}\n  \"This won't work\"\n)\n```\n\n```{r} \n{{paste}}(\n  \"But this works\"\n)\n```\nInstead, I thought it might be easier to mark the line with a code comment on the right-hand side. Like this\n```{r}\npaste(\"This looks\",\n      \"kinda normal\",  #&lt;&lt;\n      \"and it is\")\n```\nSidenote: I picked #&lt;&lt; because it kinda looks like hashtag looking left (#&lt;_&lt;) but is easier to type.\nTo make this work, just add the following lines to your setup chunk:\nhook_source &lt;- knitr::knit_hooks$get('source')\nknitr::knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) {\n  x &lt;- stringr::str_replace(x, \"^[[:blank:]]?([^*].+?)[[:blank:]]*#&lt;&lt;[[:blank:]]*$\", \"*\\\\1\")\n  hook_source(x, options)\n})\nThis add a source hook that processes the source code of the code chunk on its way into the output document after it has been evaluated. Basically, any lines in the source code with the #&lt;&lt; mark at the end of the line are modified to have the remark.js style leading * highlight indicator.\n\nlines &lt;- c('paste(\"This looks\",',\n           '      \"kinda normal\", #&lt;&lt;',\n           '      \"and it is\")')\n\nlines &lt;- stringr::str_replace(lines, \"^[[:blank:]]?([^*].+?)[[:blank:]]*#&lt;&lt;[[:blank:]]*$\", \"*\\\\1\")\ncat(lines, sep = '\\n')\n\npaste(\"This looks\",\n*     \"kinda normal\",\n      \"and it is\")\n\n\nHere’s a real example of it in practice with a code chunk from a recent presentation:\n```{r example-plot}\nggplot(tips) +\n  aes(x = tip) +\n  geom_histogram(   #&lt;&lt;\n    binwidth = 0.25 #&lt;&lt;\n  )                 #&lt;&lt;\n```\n\nNotice that the code in the source chunk and the output are both lined up!

What I wanted were slides that look more like this:\n\n\nWarning: `data_frame()` was deprecated in tibble 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `tibble()` instead.\n\n\nWarning: The `&lt;scale&gt;` argument of `guides()` cannot be `FALSE`. Use \"none\" instead as\nof ggplot2 3.3.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, with xaringan, you use a two column layout by placing the left and right column content inside .pull-left[] and .pull-right[] respectively.\n.pull-left[\n```{r}\n# plot code here\n```\n]\n\n.pull-right[\nPlot output here!\n]\nBut the default action of knitr will place the plot output inside the .pull-left[] block, keeping it in the left column.\nTo solve this problem, we need to tell knitr to hold off on evaluating the code output and to place the results in a different chunk. We can accomplish this by setting eval=FALSE in the first chunk and using the ref.label code chunk option with echo = FALSE to output the result in the second:\n.pull-left[\n```{r plot-label, eval=FALSE}\n# code chunk here\nggplot(iris) +\n  aes(Sepal.Length,\n      Sepal.Width,\n      color = Species) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n]\n\n.pull-right[\n```{r plot-label-out, ref.label=\"plot-label\", echo=FALSE}\n```\n]\n\nThis works pretty well, but the plots ended up being somewhat squished, so I created two CSS classess for the left and right columns.\n/* custom.css */\n.left-code {\n  color: #777;\n  width: 38%;\n  height: 92%;\n  float: left;\n}\n.right-plot {\n  width: 60%;\n  float: right;\n  padding-left: 1%;\n}\nI then used the following options in the YAML header of xaringan\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: [\"default\", \"custom.css\"]\n    nature:\n      ratio: 16:9\nand changed .pull-left[] ➡ .left-code[] and .pull-right[] ➡ .right-plot[].\n.left-code[\n```{r plot-label, eval=FALSE}\n# code chunk here\nggplot(iris) +\n  aes(Sepal.Length,\n      Sepal.Width,\n      color = Species) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n]\n\n.right-plot[\n```{r plot-label-out, ref.label=\"plot-label\", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), out.width=\"100%\"}\n```\n]\n\nFor best results, notice that I set the figure dimentions to 4.8 x 4.5 – and aspect ratio of approximately 9 / (16 * 0.6) – to match the .right-plot width in the CSS. I also added out.width=\"100%\" so that the image is automatically scaled to fill the column width.\nYou can set this once in your setup chunk to apply these settings to all plots so that you don’t need to repeat yourself each time.\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), fig.retina=2, out.width=\"100%\")\n```"

Then, at the end, we can reveal the final plot in full screen.\nThe xaringan portion looks like this\n```{r large-plot, eval=FALSE}\nggplot(iris) +\n  aes(Sepal.Length,\n      Sepal.Width,\n      color = Species) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  labs(x = 'Sepal Length',\n       y = 'Sepal Width') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 24, family = \"PT Sans\")\n  )\n```\n\n.plot-callout[\n```{r large-plot-callout, ref.label=\"large-plot\", fig.callout=TRUE}\n```\n]\nThe fig.callout=TRUE is a custom knitr chunk option I created that sets some default chunk values for the callout chunks so that I don’t have to repeat these every time I use this layout.\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_hooks$set(fig.callout = function(options) {\n  if (options$fig.callout) {\n    options$echo &lt;- FALSE\n    options$out.height &lt;- \"99%\"\n    options$fig.width &lt;- 16\n    options$fig.height &lt;- 8\n  }\n  options\n})\n```\nAnd then finally, I used the following CSS to place the callout in the bottom right corner, set the size of the plot and style the plot image inside.\n/* custom.css */\n.plot-callout {\n  height: 225px;\n  width: 450px;\n  bottom: 5%;\n  right: 5%;\n  position: absolute;\n  padding: 0px;\n  z-index: 100;\n}\n.plot-callout img {\n  width: 100%;\n  border: 4px solid #23373B;\n}\n\nThen the final plot is revealed on the next slide using fig.callout=TRUE but without wrapping the result chunk in side .plot-callout[].\n```{r large-plot-full-output, ref.label=\"large-plot\", fig.callout=TRUE}\n```"

The reduction in waiting time is a function of initial conditions and depends on the temperature differential, in particular between the cream and the room and coffee.\nSo, if you need faster caffeine intake: wait a bit before adding your cold cream (or almond milk).

    "text": "tl; super dr: I’m really not sure how knitr::purl() escaped my attention – maybe I thought it didn’t do something I felt was necessary at the time – but if you’ve stumbled on this page looking for a way to convert an R Markdown file into an R script, then the function you are looking for is called knitr::purl().\nTry knitr::purl(input, output, documentation = 2). It’s exactly what you’re looking for.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: A function called backstitch that backstitches knitr::knitable R Markdown files to knitr::spinable R Scripts.\n\nThere are two great ways of writing R Markdown reports. The most well known way is to use “literate programming”, where the writing and the code are intermingled an .Rmd file. This is the style of file you get when you create a new “R Markdown” file inside RStudio.\nThere’s another way of mixing code and writing inside a script, and it’s essentially the inverse of an .Rmd file.\nIn an R Markdown file, text is considered to be writing unless you wrap it in decoration, by adding backticks around inline code or by putting code in a “code chunk”:\n```{r chunk-name}\ntable(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)\n```\nTo get your final report, you call knitr’s knit function, which runs the code chunks, knits the results into the text, and writes an output file (PDF, HTML, Word, etc.).\nIn the inverse universe, you write your code and text in regular R scripts, mark specific lines as regular text by starting the lines with #', and you spin your code and text together instead of knitting.\nThis format is great for computationally-heavy scripts. The other advantage is that you can call the script directly to run all the code directly, ignoring the text aspect. I also use it a lot when I want to quickly write up a report on a set of scripts that I’ve been working with.\nDean Attali has a great write up from a couple years ago about spin that I highly recommend. And there’s a quick intro to spin in the knitr documentation, too.\nI usually try to keep computation and reporting scripts separate. But writing up the results of your code while putting it together is an incredible paradigm for data analysis…and sometimes I keep digging and digging while writing and exploring. And then I end up with a very “heavy” R Markdown (or notebook), where a lot of the data processing code really should be run separately from the reporting and visualization code.\nBut how do you convert an R Markdown file to a regular R script (or one that you could spin if you wanted to)?\nI couldn’t find the answer online, so I wrote a function called backstitch that does the conversion. It only goes one way, for now: from .Rmd to .R. But it lets you convert the whole R Markdown document to an R script, or just pull out the code chunks into a script (or both!).\nBecause it’s just a function, I made it available as a gist, which you can source directly with devtools.\n\ndevtools::source_gist('284671997992aefe295bed34bb53fde6', filename = 'backstitch.R')\n\nGive it an input file or connection (infile), an output file name (outfile, leave as NULL to return as text vector), choose output_type from script, code, both and it does the rest of the work. (There’s also an extra option called chunk_header, for you to set the initial characters for chunk sections.)\nFor example, using Yihui’s knitr-spin.Rmd example, but in reverse, we start with this file:\n\nThis is a special R script which can be used to generate a report. You can\nwrite normal text in roxygen comments.\n\nFirst we set up some options (you do not have to do this):\n\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(knitr)\nopts_chunk$set(fig.path = 'figure/silk-')\n```\n\n\nThe report begins here.\n\n\n```{r test-a, cache=FALSE}\n# boring examples as usual\nset.seed(123)\nx = rnorm(5)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n\nYou can use the special syntax {{code}} to embed inline expressions, e.g.\n`r mean(x) + 2`\nis the mean of x plus 2.\nThe code itself may contain braces, but these are not checked.  Thus,\nperfectly valid (though very strange) R code such as `{2 + 3} - {{4 - 5}}`\ncan lead to errors because `2 + 3}} - {{4 - 5` will be treated as inline code.\n\nNow we continue writing the report. We can draw plots as well.\n\n\n```{r test-b, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}\npar(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)); plot(x)\n```\n\n\nActually you do not have to write chunk options, in which case knitr will use\ndefault options. For example, the code below has no options attached:\n\n\n```{r }\nvar(x)\nquantile(x)\n```\n\n\nAnd you can also write two chunks successively like this:\n\n\n```{r test-chisq5}\nsum(x^2) # chi-square distribution with df 5\n```\n\n```{r test-chisq4}\nsum((x - mean(x))^2) # df is 4 now\n```\n\n\nDone. Call spin('knitr-spin.R') to make silk from sow's ear now and knit a\nlovely purse.\n\nand backstitch it into this file:\n\ninfile &lt;- url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yihui/knitr/master/inst/examples/knitr-spin.Rmd')\noutput &lt;- backstitch(infile, output_type = 'script', chunk_header = \"#+\")\ncat(\"```r\", output, \"```\", sep = \"\\n\")\n#' This is a special R script which can be used to generate a report.

    "text": "Moving to main street\nOver the past year, there’s been a concerted effort among people who create and manage git repositories to move away from the default branch name of master to something more intentional: typically main.\nRStudio and the tidyverse team recently undertook the giant challenge of changing the default branch of RStudio’s approximately 350 public repositories (most of which are all open source!). Jenny Bryan wrote about the branch-changing experience on the tidyverse blog.\nWatching Jennys’s superb stewardship of the change inspired a new app branchMover. Or is it named Branch Mover? Admittedly, I didn’t spend much time thinking about the name because the app won’t be in your life for very long.\nThe goal of branchMover is to help you coordinate a default branch change across the repos you maintain. The app shows you all of the repos associated with your GitHub account and their current default branch. Because you might want to start with your less popular repos, you can sort by number of forks and stars on each repo.\nThere’s also a button to change the default branch. When you click the button, the app clones your repo and uses the usethis package and the recently added usethis::git_default_branch_rename() function to update the default branch of your repo.\nI followed Jenny’s lead and the app will create an issue announcing the change. If all goes well, the issue is closed a few seconds later with instructions for your users on how to update any local copies of your repo. If it doesn’t go well, the issue stay open as a reminder to you to finish the process.\nUnfortunately, branchMover doesn’t update the default branch in your local copies of your repos. Thankfully, this is relatively pain-free with the usethis::git_default_branch_rediscover() function, added in usethis version 2.1.2.\nThe next time you find yourself in your local copy of your repo, run git_default_branch_rediscover() to reconfigure your branch situation.\ngit_default_branch_rediscover()\n#&gt; ℹ Default branch of the source repo 'jennybc/happy-git-with-r': 'main'\n#&gt; ✓ Default branch of local repo has moved: 'master' --&gt; 'main'"

But in practice, most Git repos have an effective default branch. If there’s only one branch, this is it! It is the branch that most bug fixes and features get merged in to. It is the branch you see when you first visit a repo on a site such as GitHub. On a Git remote, it is the branch that HEAD points to. The default branch may not be precisely defined in Git itself, but most of us know it when we see it.\nHistorically, master has been the most common name for the default branch, but main is an increasingly popular choice. There is coordinated change across the Git ecosystem that is making it easier for users to make this switch, for example:\n\nRegarding Git and Branch Naming, statement from the Git project and the Software Freedom Conservancy regarding the new init.defaultBranch configuration option\nRenaming the default branch frommaster, GitHub’s roadmap for supporting the shift away from master\nThe new Git default branch name, same, but for GitLab\n\nJenny Bryan, Renaming the default branch\n\n\nBranch Mover was built by Garrick Aden-Buie.

    "text": "Progressive List Slides\nTo create progressive slides in xaringan, use two dashes --, all alone on their own line, to indicate a pause in the current slide.\n---\nclass: highlight-last-item\n\n# Best Brownies, Ingredients\n\n- 1 cup milk chocolate chips\n\n--\n\n- 2 large eggs\n\n--\n\n- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\nxaringan actually creates new slides for each pause, where each slide shows the content up to the pause. So the markdown below creates three slides, the first having one bullet point, the second having two bullet points, and the third having the full list.\nWhen rendered, three slides are created and the final slide contains the following HTML.\n&lt;div class=\"remark-slide-content highlight-last-item\"&gt;\n  &lt;h1 id=\"best-brownies-ingredients\"&gt;Best Brownies, Ingredients&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup milk chocolate chips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 large eggs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 teaspoons vanilla extract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"remark-slide-number\"&gt;3 / 3&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nThe first and second partial slides look exactly the same, except that the &lt;ul&gt; unordered list element contains only the first one or first two &lt;li&gt; list items.\nIf you’re building up a slide full of bullet points, you’re probably talking about the last element in the list as you reveal each new list item. We can create a neat effect where the last list item — hence the :last-of-type pseudo-class — is highlighted by softening the previous list items or by changing the styling of the last item.\nIn HTML, lists are unordered &lt;ul&gt; or ordered &lt;ol&gt; lists containing list elements created with the &lt;li&gt; tag. Here’s a small example, similar to the structure of the HTML and CSS we’ll use for xaringan.\n\n\nHTML\n&lt;ul class=\"demo\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;item one&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;item two&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;item three&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\n\nCSS\n.demo &gt; li {\n  color: gray;\n}\n.demo &gt; li:last-of-type {\n  color: purple;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n\nResult\n\nitem one\nitem two\nitem three\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe .demo &gt; li rule styles the list items under the &lt;ul&gt; tag with the .demo class, setting the text color to a muted gray. The .demo &gt; li:last-of-type rule styles the last &lt;li&gt; that’s one level below (that’s what the &gt; means) the .demo element."

    "section": "Pre-reqs: Workflow Setup",
    "text": "Pre-reqs: Workflow Setup\n\nBlogdown, GitHub, and Netlify, oh my!\nTo get started you need three things:\n\na blogdown website\nhosted on GitHub and\npublished via Netlify.\n\nThere are a lot of great resources for setting up and connecting these components if you haven’t already, but the best place to start is the blogdown book. The process for setting up Netlify to serve your GitHub-hosted blogdown site is described in detail in the Netlify section of the Deployment chapter of the blogdown book. Alison Presmanes Hill’s Up and running with blogdown is another excellent guide for getting started down this path.\nI’m a huge fan of GitHub (or really open sharing of code) and I highly recommend using Netlify for a number of reasons. The main benefit of this combination is that Netlify’s continuous deployment builds your website for you whenever you update your source files. Netlify also makes it easy to set up your website for https with free, managed certificates]netlify-https, and their integration with GitHub makes [blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify excellent partners.\nNote part of setup should include configuring the baseurl option in your config.toml file. This is the base of URLs used in your website wherever an absolute URL (i.e. the full URL rather than a relative or partial URL) is created. This is somewhat template-dependent, but this URL is used wherever a link is parsed with hugo’s absURL command.\nIn my case, baseurl is configured like this:\nbaseurl = \"https://www.garrickadenbuie.com\"\n\n\nEnable Deploy Previews\nNetlify provides a feature called deploy contexts that allows you to build multiple versions of your site. For example, Netlify can automatically build a deploy preview of your website for all pull requests. When enabled, a preview version of your website is automatically built when a pull request is created in the site’s GitHub repo. The preview is also updated whenever additional commits are added to the pull request.\nTo turn on this feature, select your website from your list of sites hosted with Netlify. Then click on Site settings and find Build & deploy on the left menu bar. Under this settings group, click the Edit settings button and select Automatically build deploy previews for all pull requests next to Deploy previews.\n\n\n\nEnable automatic deploy previews for pull requests in your site’s settings.\n\n\n\n\nSet up netlify.toml\nFinally, you need to create a file called netlify.toml in your website’s root directory. This file allows you to very specifically customize your Netlify settings in addition to, or in place of, the settings available through the Netlify web app.\nTwo modifications from the default hugo command used to build the deploy preview improve the workflow:\n\nAdding -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL ensures that URLs generated by hugo on the deploy preview point to the deploy preview. Without this, absolute URLs created by your hugo template (or theme) will point to your baseurl (your primary site) rather than the deploy preview, meaning that it will occasionally be impossible or difficult to test that your links work as expected in the preview version.\nAdding --buildFuture ensures that posts scheduled in the future are also rendered regardless of publication date. Without this, posts scheduled for future publication dates won’t be displayed in the preview. You may also wish to enable --buildDrafts as well (but see the side note on drafts below).\n\nWe can apply these settings in the context of deploy previews using the context.deploy-preview header, and if you’ve enabled branch deploys in the step above, you can also enable these features under context.branch-deploy.\nAltogether, my netlify.toml file looks like this.\n# netlify.toml\n[context.deploy-preview]\ncommand = \"hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL --buildFuture\"\n\n[context.branch-deploy]\ncommand = \"hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL --buildFuture\"\n\nSide note: Drafts\nYou can mark a post as a draft by setting draft: true in the post’s YAML. This might even be the default when you create a new post (depending on your theme and settings).\nBut I don’t recommend using this flag for two reasons.\nFirst, it’s likely that you’ll forget to remove it before publishing. The local live preview will show your post, so it’s easy to push your post only to discover that you forgot to set draft: false when your post doesn’t appear on your site (not that I’ve ever done that before.)\nSecond, you can achieve the same results by writing and preparing your post in a post-specific branch and pull request. This keeps your source code, writing, and image in a self-contained branch in your repository (so you can get back to it later if it takes some time to finish it) and it allows you to take advantage of Netlify’s deploy preview feature.\nIf you do want to use hugo’s draft posts, you can add --buildDrafts to the hugo command in your netlify.toml so that Netlify renders draft posts on deploy previews. Read more in the Building a website for local preview section of the blogdown book."

If you’d like to “schedule” your post for a day in the future, you set the date now. (Remind yourself it’s an aspirational goal and not a hard deadline.) (And see below for the reason for the scare quotes around schedule. Spoiler: it’s not automatic.)\n\n\n\nSet the post date to be sometime in the future. (It was 2019-03-15 when I took this picture.)\n\n\nNote that you can also use publishDate or separately set both publishDate and date. If you use publishDate, the post will not be rendered until on or after the publishDate, but once published the post will appear to have been written on date (although this depends on the settings of your hugo theme). This configuration parameter needs to be set in your post’s YAML header.\nIf you’re writing your posts in R Markdown with the .Rmd extension, another option is to set date in the post YAML header to\ndate: '``r 'r'` Sys.Date()`'\nto make the post’s date reflect the day your .Rmd was rendered to hugo’s HTML. While I like this idea in theory, you may later need to re-render your post due to changes on your site. If you use your post’s date in your site’s permalinks1 — for example, with URLs like /2019/03/18/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow — then this change may inadvertently change your site’s URLs and invalidate links you’ve previously shared.\n\n\n\nFill out the rest of your post information.\n\n\nYour blank page is ready! Run blogdown::serve_site() and write your post draft, previewing locally as you write.\n\n\n\nWriting this post in RStudio with the Source and Viewer panes maximized for “live preview” feel.\n\n\n\n\nCommit and Push\nCommit your post when it’s complete or after you’ve written a section or a draft version (commits are cheap!). When you have at least one commit in your post branch, say your draft post, push those commits to GitHub. Navigate to the GitHub page for your website repo and open a pull request from your post branch.\nWhen you do you’ll see a yellow dot next to the most recent commit. When it turns into a green check mark, your preview is ready.\n\n\n\nYour deploy preview is ready on Netlify!\n\n\nClick on the check mark and then click on Details. This will take you to a preview of your website at a URL like\nhttps://deploy-preview-&lt;pr#&gt;--&lt;website-name&gt;.netlify.com/\nThis site works exactly like it will when fully deployed, except for the two details that we changed above in netlify.toml:\n\nInternal links produced by Hugo will point to deploy-preview-NN...netlify.com rather than your baseurl address.\nFuture posts (and draft posts, if enabled) will be rendered as well.\n\n\n\nFinal Checks\nI usually (read: when I remember) try to pause here and run a few quick tests and checks on the post, either in RStudio or using the deploy preview link to the post.\n\nRun Check Spelling… in RStudio (under Edit menu)\nRun xfun::optipng() on the directory where the post’s images are stored (including plots output by R) for lossless reduction of the size of .png images\nRun the W3C Link Checker on the post preview to make sure all links are valid.\nCheck YAML metadata is filled out, including title, description, categories, tags, etc.\nCheck that all images have alt text. A web accessibility evaluation tool can be helpful here.\n\n\n\nPublish\nThe final step is to publish your post — merge your pull request to master and Netlify will deploy your site!\nOf course, if you’ve scheduled your post for a future release date, it’s slightly more complicated. Hugo sites — and by extension blogdown sites — are static. The entire site is compiled and rendered once instead of every time a visitor access a page (like WordPress).\nAs far as I know, there’s no built-in mechanism to schedule the re-rendering of your site at a future date, so you’ll need to manually trigger the rendering. In my workflow, this means choosing from the following two options:\n\nWait until on or after the date of your post to merge the pull request to master. Netlify will build and deploy your website immediately.\nMerge your pull request, but then later use the Netlify settings page for your site to trigger a rebuild. This seems more complicated to me, so I recommend using the first option.\n\nBut if you’re determined to fully automate this process, Netlify does integrate with Zapier, an online tool for automating tasks.\nThat’s it! Once you’ve merged your post branch to the master branch, your post is out there in the world, just as soon as Netlify finishes building your site.\n\n\n\nEnable automatic deploy previews for pull requests in your site’s settings.\nCreate a New Branch with an informative name, like post-&lt;slug&gt;.\nOpening the New Post RStudio addin.\nSet the post date to be sometime in the future. (It was 2019-03-15 when I took this picture.)\nFill out the rest of your post information.\nWriting this post in RStudio with the Source and Viewer panes maximized for “live preview” feel.\nYour deploy preview is ready on Netlify!"

Way down deep underneath the hood, the DAG is rendered using TikZ and LaTeX (via the texPreview package), and the app allows the user to tweak the appearance of the DAG without having to learn TikZ.\nOne of the appearance changes that the user can make is to change the color of the graph’s edges or nodes, using the colors defined in the xcolor LaTeX package. Rather than provide an open-ended text box, I wanted to give the user a dropdown menu containing the available colors.\nIt turned out to be just a few lines of code to grab the .def files from the xcolor package page, strip out the non-color related TeX lines, and create a simple tibble of the provided colors.\nQuick sidenote: the .def files are actually .def.gz (or gzipped files), but we can read these directly into R using url() inside gzcon(), which is then passed to readLines() to read the uncompressed text.

    "section": "A brief history of countdown",
    "text": "A brief history of countdown\nBefore we talk about all the new things in countdown, I want to take a small minute to get nostalgic. I hope you don’t mind indulging me (or skip ahead if you’d rather get right to business).\n\nrstudio::conf(2019)\nIn 2019 I went to rstudio::conf in Austin, TX where a highlight of the conference, for me, was the Train-the-Trainer: Tidyverse Track workshop by Garrett Grolemund and Greg Wilson. That workshop specifically marked a turning point in my career and I left rstudio::conf very inspired to build and teach cool things in R.\nI also walked away from rstudio::conf(2019) with another key take away: it was time to learn JavaScript. An odd thing to take away from an R conference, yes. (Although I don’t think I’m alone in this kind of realization; this year many people left rstudio::conf(2022) thinking that it’s time to learn Python.)\nThese two inspirations came together in my first post-conf project: a countdown timer for xaringan slides.\n\n\n\n\nA slide from Garrett’s workshop materials with a 4-minute timer in the lower right corner.\n\n\n\nGarrett used timers extensively to pace break out sessions and they worked surprisingly well to keep everyone on track. One funny thing I noticed during our workshop session was that Garrett would frequently have to switch to slide-edit mode (in Keynote, I think) to fiddle with the timer as he adjusted the length of the “your turn” session. This is pretty normal; an instructor probably has a sense of approximately how long an activity will take and we’ll often will adjust the time spent on the activity based on how the audience is doing, how well the material is working, or how close to lunch or a break we are in the session.\nSo my idea was to build a countdown timer that you could drop into a slide and easily use to time an event. I also wanted to make it easy to adjust the time, but my JavaScript skills were limited to what I could learn from StackOverflow, so I compromised and decided that you could only bump the timer up. After all it’s not like you have to end the timer, you can always just move on in your slides.\n\n\nIt becomes an R package\nI cobbled together an R package that was a fairly decent R interface around a collection of lines of JavaScript that I barely understood, that somehow assembled into an actual working timer. I made a cool intro-slash-docs presentation and would probably have sat on it for a while longer if it weren’t for Mara Averick who spotted my GitHub activity and soft-announced the package for me.\nNot long after that, and slightly to my horror (please don’t go looking at my JavaScript code), Hadley submitted an issue. Actually, two issues. Obviously, that was an exciting turn of events. His suggestions were solid and helped improve the quality of the timer: he suggested a warning state and a full-screen view/app.\nAmazingly, the package worked! People really seemed to like it, it solved a niche but useful need that many people have when teaching, and it let me learn a ton about how to build htmlwidgets in R. I’m proud of the R interface — it’s easy to use and configure — and I think the feature set hits the right balance of looking good right out of the box without doing too much.\n\n\nBut that JavaScript code…\nSince I wrote the first version of countdown, I’ve learned a whole lot more JavaScript and I know a whole lot more about how to build web things in R. countdown’s underlying code has always haunted me a little, but on the other hand it was chugging away, still working fine for most people in most situations.\nSo I left it alone…\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the countdown GitHub repository page where the phrase “3 years ago” is highlighted. That is GitHub’s summary of the last time I updated countdown.\n\n\n…for almost 3 years.\nAnd wow how much has changed in the three plus years since rstudio::conf(2019). Not only did I lead a workshop about JavaScript for Shiny users at rstudio::conf(2020) (hashtag js4shiny), and not only do I now work for RStudio1, but I was also part of the program committee for conference planning. Which means I saw colleagues were still using my countdown timer in workshop slides.\nAnd that old franken-JavaScript code still haunted me.\nSo this year, in part inspired by the return of the final rstudio::conf, I decided that finally rewriting that JavaScript would be the perfect conference side-hack project.\nWhich led to countdown v0.4.0 arriving on CRAN!"

    "section": "coundown v0.4.0",
    "text": "coundown v0.4.0\n\n\n\n\nThe Old JavaScript\nMy first implementation relied heavily on the JavaScript function setTimeout, which takes a function and a delay in milliseconds: setTimeout(function, delay). When called, the browser waits until the delay is over and then calls the function.\nA neat trick with setTimeout is that you can call it recursively inside a function as a way to run that function repeatedly. Below I’ve defined a function timerTick() that moves the timer forward one tick. It also uses setTimeout to schedule the next tick of the timer. And by using a delay of 1000 milliseconds, I’ve set up a function that runs once per second — just like a clock 😉.\nThis is, essentially, how countdown worked before. For each run of timerTick(), I would decrement the number of remaining seconds by one and update the timer. If there’s time left on the timer, then timerTick() shcedules another update for 1 second later. If there isn’t any time left, we can stop the timer by simply not scheduling any more timer updates.\n\nfunction timerTick() {\n  const timer = document.getElementById('timer')\n\n  // update the timer\n  timer.value -= 1\n  console.log(`${timer.value}s remaining...`)\n\n  if (timer.value &gt; 0) {\n    // there's time left, schedule next tick\n    setTimeout(timerTick, 1000)\n  } else {\n    // time is up, reset the timer\n    console.log(`Time's up!`)\n    timer.classList.remove('running')\n    timer.innerText = 'Start Timer'\n    // notice we don't schedule another tick\n  }\n}\n\nAnd this works*! Try it out by clicking the button below.\nStart Countdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Almost. This almost works. It works pretty well if you start the timer and then don’t touch the browser window or switch to another tab. So it does usually work fine when you’re presenting slides.\nBut it turns out that setTimeout() is more like suggestThatThisRunsLater(). There’s really no guarantee that the function you scheduled to run 1,000 milliseconds from now is actually going to run in 1,000 milliseconds.\nThere are many things that can get in the way of that function being run when you expect it. If you move to a different tab and come back, for example, there’s no guarantee that the background tab would keep chugging along, running my function every seconds. Browsers have better things to do and they’ll de-prioritize pages that aren’t being actively shown to users. This means that sometimes setTimeout(fn, 1000) runs fn 1 second from now, but depending on what else the browser is doing it could be a lot longer than that.\nSo how do we get around this? 🤔\n\n\nAll New JavaScript\nThe new JavaScript version of countdown does something really simple. It doesn’t rely on setTimeout() directly to keep track of the time.\nYes, it still schedules the next tick on 1 second intervals, but it doesn’t trust that exactly one second has passed. Now, when the user starts the timer, countdown will note when the timer should end and recalculates the remaining time with each tick. This means the updates are always accurate, even if there happen to be 4 seconds between consecutive ticks.\nIt also means that we can bump a running timer up or down by moving that end time later or earlier. To stop the timer, we just note how much time is left and to restart it again we recalculate the end time based on how much time was left when we paused.\nThere’s a small amount of internal state to keep track of, which happens to basically cry out for a JavaScript class. So the new countdown timer is implemented via a CountdownTimer class.\nHere’s a sketch of the class containing three core methods:\n\ntick() runs the timer, like above, except this time we calculate the remaining number of seconds on each tick. When there are less than 0 seconds left, we call the finish() method.\nstart() gets things started by calculating when the timer should end and kicking off the tick() method.\nfinish() wraps up by resetting the timer.\n\n\nclass Timer {\n  constructor(el, duration) {\n    // The timer's attached to a button\n    this.element = el\n    // it has a duration that's set when initiated\n    this.duration = duration\n    // and it will have an end when running\n    this.end = null\n  }\n\n  tick () {\n    // decide and report how much time is left\n    const remaining = this.end - Date.now()\n    console.log(`${remaining / 1000}s remaining...`)\n\n    // and then schedule the next tick or finish up\n    if (remaining &gt; 0) {\n      setTimeout(this.tick.bind(this), 1000)\n    } else {\n      this.finish()\n    }\n  }\n\n  start () {\n    if (this.end) return\n\n    console.clear()\n    this.element.innerText = 'Timer is running...'\n    // the timer ends duration (s) * 1000 (ms) from now\n    this.end = Date.now() + this.duration * 1000\n    this.tick()\n  }\n\n  finish () {\n    this.end = null\n    this.element.innerText = 'Start Timer'\n    console.log(`Time's up!`)\n  }\n}\n\nStart Countdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the 5-second timer by clicking the button above. Notice that even though we used the same setTimeout(code, 1000) as before to schedule each tick for one second later, because this version precisely reports how much time is left you can see that our timer drifts a bit away from running perfectly once per second.\n\n\nNew buttons and keyboard interactions\nBeyond the improved timer, the new CountdownTimer class makes it a whole lot easier to add additional features that need to build on the timer’s internal state.\nFor example, you can now\n\nClick to start or stop the timer\nDouble click to reset\nBump the timer up or down using the + and − buttons\nDo all of the above with keyboard shortcus:\n\nSpace or Enter to start or stop the timer\nEsc to reset\n↑ or ↓ to bump up or down\n\n\n\n\nShiny!\nThe shiny new countdown package also has plenty of Shiny features. Countdown timers can be controlled directly from Shiny with countdown_action() or countdown_update() and timers are now also inputs that report their state!\nYou can find an example Shiny app with a timer, plus an explanation of how it all works, by running\nto launch an example app. The example app is also available on my website at apps.garrickadenbuie.com/countdown-shiny-example.\nIn a nutshell, the timer will report its state using its input id. For example, countdown(id = \"timer\") will report its state to Shiny via input$timer. The input reports the event that caused the state to change and the state of the timer:\nHere’s another small app that demonstrate how you could use a button to toggle the state of the timer.\n\n\nImproved countdown App\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the full screen countdown timer app.\n\n\n\nAll of the Shiny updates mentioned above are used to power countdown_app(), a full screen Shiny app for running timers. These work really well for timing speakers at conferences or for a quick way to keep track of a break out session in workshops or meetings.\nThe app itself received a few upgrades, most importantly is the ability to share a timer with the settings you want using the URL. This uses Shiny’s Bookmarking state features to save your settings in the URL and restore them when you load that link.\nFor example, this timer is a 20 minute timer with a warning at 5 minutes that updates every 10 seconds.\n\n\nNew Options\nFinally, countdown gained a new option. You can now start the timer as soon as it is visible by setting start_immediately = TRUE. The “as as soon as it’s visible” works pretty well: in xaringan and Quarto slides it starts when you land on the slide and in regular HTML documents the timer starts when you scroll the timer into view.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that countdown now uses prismatic for color calculations. I was really happy to see that Emil added best_contrast() and switching to use that function cleaned up a lot of internal code for me!"

Ultimately, what we need from a palette function is a function that takes a single argument n and returns n colors.\nBut in our case, we want to give the user some control over which colors are used, so our palette function needs to have some additional parameters. To balance both needs, we’ll use a closure, which is fancy word for a function that returns another function. The outer function sets up the color choices and the inner function returns a simple function of n that gives ggplot2 our brand’s colors.\nWhat’s great is that we can do whatever we want inside these functions. You can use this opportunity to re-order the colors for specific values of n, for example.\nWe’re going to make specific decisions about the colors used when n == 2. We want the palette to return two colors, branded_colors[primary] and another color. The other argument specifies the name of the second (or other) color, and we’ll first try to lookup the color name from the brand colors, but we’ll also let the user specify a manual color.\n\nbranded_pal &lt;- function(\n  primary = \"blue\",\n  other = \"grey\",\n  direction = 1\n) {\n  stopifnot(primary %in% names(branded_colors))\n\n  function(n) {\n    if (n &gt; 6) warning(\"Branded Color Palette only has 6 colors.\")\n\n    if (n == 2) {\n      other &lt;- if (!other %in% names(branded_colors)) {\n        other\n      } else {\n        branded_colors[other]\n      }\n      color_list &lt;- c(other, branded_colors[primary])\n    } else {\n      color_list &lt;- branded_colors[1:n]\n    }\n\n    color_list &lt;- unname(unlist(color_list))\n    if (direction &gt;= 0) color_list else rev(color_list)\n  }\n}\n\nHere are a few examples of the colors given by the pallete function returned by branded_pal() for various values of n.\n\nbranded_pal()(2)\n\n[1] \"#8d96a3\" \"#00798c\"\n\nbranded_pal(other = \"green\")(2)\n\n[1] \"#66a182\" \"#00798c\"\n\nbranded_pal()(3)\n\n[1] \"#00798c\" \"#d1495b\" \"#edae49\"\n\nbranded_pal(direction = -1)(3)\n\n[1] \"#edae49\" \"#d1495b\" \"#00798c\""

A common example would be comparing local cancer rates with statewide averages, and in these cases having a muted color for the comparison is incredibly helpful.\nHere’s an example using the Texas housing sales data that ships with ggplot2 to showcase monthly total home sales in Austin with Dallas sale volume shown for reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicate discrete/continuous in the function name\nIf you’re using this as guidance for building your own discrete color scale, my final tip would be to modify the name of the scale function and append _d to the end to indicate that the scale is discrete.\nscale_color_branded_d()\nYou’ll want to leave space in your package for a continuous color scale that will receive a _c() suffix.\n\n\nCreate fill scale functions, too\nFinally, you’ll also want to create scale_fill_...() functions as well. You can create those using the same branded_palette() functions you used for scale_color_branded(), with the small tweak of replacing \"color\" with \"fill\" as the first argument to ggplot2::discrete_scale()\n\n\nWhat about three colors?\nEmily Riederer has a neat function in her Rtistic package template that I highly recommend you check out if you’re making a package of branded ggplot2 and rmarkdown themes.\nShe calls it scale_color_opinionated() and it works similarly to the functions I’ve laid out, except that it provides a color scale specifically for categorical variables with three levels: \"good\", \"neutral\", and \"bad\".\nIf this sounds like something you do frequently, consider adding an opinionated function to your package!\n\n\nThanks\nThanks for reading!

I might not be the typical user, but this always seems like a missed opportunity to me.\nOf course, writing good documentation is tricky. And considering that a good package also has vignettes, a README, a related (blogdown) blog post, and possibly even a pkgdown site, making sure the documentation is up-to-date in all of these places can put undue burden on the package developers."

    "text": "Don’t Repeat Yourself, Clone Yourself\n\nIn the spirit of Don’t Repeat Yourself and maximizing the potential of knitr and R Markdown – and the fact that you can use R Markdown for all of the above pieces – I remembered recently reading about child documents in knitr.\nI posted my idea to Jonathan’s thread and shortly afterwards @BrodieGaslam wrote back with an idea that really makes the best of child documents. Here’s the full idea:\n\nWrite repeatable sections in short .Rmd files.\nAdapting from Brodie’s vetr package as an example, these files are stored in man/fragments:\nvignettes/\n├── alike.Rmd\n├── styles.css\n└── vetr.Rmd\nman/\n└── fragments/\n    ├── declarative-checks.Rmd\n    ├── microbenchmark.Rmd\n    ├── related-packages.Rmd\n    ├── trust-but-verify.Rmd\n    ├── valaddin.Rmd\n    └── vetting-expressions.Rmd\nNotice man/fragments/related-packages.Rmd. It’s a short R Markdown file with a list of (not surprisingly) related packages – the kind of section that might be included in both the package overview vignette and the README.\n\nman/fragments/related-packages.Rmd &gt;\n* [`vetr`](https://github.com/brodieG/vetr) by Yours Truly\n* [`asserthat`](https://github.com/hadley/assertthat) by Hadley Wickham\n* [`assertive`](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/assertive) by Richie Cotton\n* [`checkmate`](https://github.com/mllg/checkmate) by Michel Lang\n\nThe following packages also perform related tasks ...\nCaution: If the fragments are stored in a sub-folder of vignettes/, R CMD check may try to render them and can throw an error when they fail to render because they aren’t complete documents.\n\n\n\nReference the repeatable sections using the child chunk option.\nknitr provides a child document chunk option that you can use to embed R Markdown from an external file. Anywhere that you would re-use the documentation, you simply include the following, such as in the vetr package vignette. Again, the following are from the vetr package documentation files.\n\nvignettes/vetr.Rmd &gt;\n## Alternatives\n\nThere are many alternatives available to `vetr`.  We do a survey of the\nfollowing in our [parameter validation functions][4] review:\n\n```{r child=\"../man/fragments/related-packages.Rmd\"} `r ''`\n```\nThis R Markdown “chunk” can be used anywhere else you need it, such as in the package README.Rmd file.\n\n\nREADME.Rmd &gt;\n## Alternatives\n\nThere are many alternatives available to `vetr`.  We do a survey of the\nfollowing in our [parameter validation functions][5] review:\n\n```{r child=\"man/fragments/related-packages.Rmd\"} `r ''`\n```\nThe major advantage here is to be able to update the documentation in one place and have those changes propagate to “parent” documents. It’s also useful to be able to arrange or choose the content shown in certain places differently depending on the location (or even during editing!). For example, READMEs typically include installation instructions, but these would be redundant if included in the package vignettes.\nThe above examples can be extended for use in pkgdown articles (which are essentially an extension of vignettes) or for blogdown posts if you develop your package and blog source on the same machine.\n\n\nUpdate: December 4, 2019\nMaëlle Salmon helpfully pointed out and then tracked down the solution to an issue that may pop up with the method I originally proposed in this post.\nRather than storing your R Markdown fragments in a subfolder in vignettes/, such as vignettes/fragments, they should instead be stored in man/fragments.\nI updated the post above to match Maëlle’s advice. Thanks to Maëlle Salmon for the helpful advice that satisfies R CMD Check!\n\nThanks @BrodieGaslam for the tip and @carroll_jono for kicking off this thread!"

This way, I now have the week number to which each day in the sequence belongs, but because we may be interested in creating calendars that span multiple years, the addition of isoyear() protects against repeated week numbers.\nThis week year combination is destined for the y axis as it marks the row to which each day belongs. The y axis is typically increasing, with the smallest value at the bottom. This means that, if left as strings, the week of \"2019 - 25\" would be below the week \"2019 - 26\". Because calendars are typically read top to bottom, I used fct_rev() here to both convert {isoyear} - {isoweek} into a factor and then reverse the factor order so that 2019 - 25 is the last factor.\n\n# shows the _last 6_ week_year factor levels\ndates %&gt;% pull(week_year) %&gt;% levels() %&gt;% tail()\n\n[1] \"2019 - 31\" \"2019 - 30\" \"2019 - 29\" \"2019 - 28\" \"2019 - 27\" \"2019 - 26\"\n\n\nFor a bit of convenience later, I then pull out the rows of dates representing the first day of the month, to use later when adding the colored boxes and text labels marking the start of a new month.\n\nday_one &lt;- dates %&gt;%\n  filter(day(day) == 1)\n\nday_one\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  day        wday_name weekend isoweek month  isoyear week_year\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    \n1 2019-07-01 Mon       FALSE        27 July      2019 2019 - 27\n2 2019-08-01 Thu       FALSE        31 August    2019 2019 - 31\n\n\n\n\nBetter week labels\nQuick, what’s the starting date of week 31 in 2019?\nOk, fine, that was too hard. What month of 2019 does week 31 belong to?\nTrick question: that week starts on July 29, 2019 but ends on August 4th.\nSo… we need better axis labels than 2019 - 31. A reasonable replacement would be to use the day of the month of the week’s starting day.\nThe following code filters dates to include the first day of each week (hint: it’s Monday). Then, I use month(day, label = TRUE) to get the abbreviated month name (abbr = TRUE is the default) that I’ll append to the day of the month of each day.\nBut when a given week is preceded by a week from the same month, it would be visually distracting to see Jul repeated with each date — Jul 1, Jul 8, Jul 15, and so on — in the axis labels. For easy scanning, I only included the month in the label if the month changed from the month before. In other words, when month == lag(month), I just need the day of the month the given week.\n\nweek_start_labels &lt;- dates %&gt;%\n  filter(wday_name == \"Mon\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(day) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    month = month(day, label = TRUE),\n    label = case_when(\n      month == lag(month) ~ paste(day(day)),\n      TRUE ~ sprintf(\"%s %4i\", month, day(day))\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(label, week_year) %&gt;%\n  reduce(setNames)\n\nThe last two lines there are a neat trick to take a two column tibble (or a two-element list) and convert it into a named vector using purrr::reduce(). The first argument becomes the vector values and second argument becomes the vector names:\n\nlist(1:5, letters[1:5]) %&gt;% purrr::reduce(setNames)\n\na b c d e \n1 2 3 4 5 \n\n\n\n\nA special tibble for special days\nI used yet another tibble to store holidays and other important dates related to the project. Each day can have a label, color, and/or fill.\n\nhighlight_days &lt;- tribble(\n         ~ day,            ~ label,   ~ color,    ~ fill,\n  \"2019-07-02\", \"Project Kick Off\", \"#02307a\", \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-07-04\",         \"July 4th\", \"#b4436c\", \"#b4436c\",\n  \"2019-07-12\",          \"LOI Due\", \"#02307a\", \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-07-26\",      \"First Draft\", \"#02307a\", \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-08-05\",        \"Work week\", \"#02307a\", \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-08-06\",                 \"\",        NA, \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-08-07\",                 \"\",        NA, \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-08-08\",                 \"\",        NA, \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-08-09\",                 \"\",        NA, \"#02307a\",\n  \"2019-08-16\", \"Final Submission\", \"#02307a\", \"#02307a\"\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(day), ymd)\n\n\n\nFinally, ggplot the calendar\nFinally, we arrive at the main event, the actual creation of the calendar with ggplot2.\nHere I use geom_tile() for each day, and then overlay tiles for the start-of-the-month days and the highlighted holiday and project-specific days. I also used geom_text() to add annotations to the special days, which I pushed to the top or bottom left corner of the day box.\n\n\nCode to produce the calendar\ngcal &lt;-\n  dates %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Softly fill in the weekend days\n    weekend = case_when(weekend ~ \"#f8f8f8\", TRUE ~ \"#FFFFFF\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(wday_name, week_year) +\n  # the calendar grid\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = weekend), color = \"#aaaaaa\") +\n  # highlight first day of each month\n  geom_tile(\n    data = day_one,\n    fill = \"#f78154\",\n    alpha = 0.25,\n    width = 1,\n    height = 1\n  ) +\n  # add name of month to the first day\n  geom_text(\n    data = day_one,\n    aes(label = month),\n    family = \"PT Sans Narrow\",\n    color = \"#f78154\",\n    size = 4,\n    # push text to the top left corner\n    hjust = 0,\n    nudge_x = -0.45,\n    vjust = 1,\n    nudge_y = 0.45\n  ) +\n  # highlight project-specific days\n  geom_tile(\n    data = dates %&gt;% inner_join(highlight_days, by = \"day\"),\n    aes(fill = fill),\n    alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  # add the label from the highlighted days\n  geom_text(\n    data = dates %&gt;% inner_join(highlight_days, by = \"day\"),\n    aes(label = label, color = color),\n    family = \"PT Sans Narrow\",\n    size = 2,\n    # push to bottom left corner\n    hjust = 0,\n    nudge_x = -0.45,\n    vjust = 0,\n    nudge_y = -0.40\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(position = \"top\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = week_start_labels) +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  scale_color_identity() +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) +\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"PT Sans\") +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(\"PT Sans Narrow\"),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x.top = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.x.top = element_blank(),\n  )\n\ngcal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate month boundaries\nFor a final touch, I wanted stronger differentiation between months. In the following code, I convert wday_name and week_year into integers that indicate the center point of each box.\nThen, using the fact that the top and bottom (and right and left) sides of the box are +/- 0.5 units from the center, I create three line segments. The first extends from the bottom left corner of the day starting the week with the month change (left side of the plot) until the left edge of the box representing the start of the next month. The second segment line travels up the left edge of that box. And the third and final segment travels from the top left corner of the month-changing day to the right edge of the plot.\n\nmonth_boundaries &lt;- day_one %&gt;%\n  select(day, month, wday_name, week_year) %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(wday_name, week_year), as.integer) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    left = map2(wday_name, week_year, ~ {\n      # n/a if month changes on first day\n      if (.x == 1) return(tibble(.missing = NA))\n      tibble(\n        x = 0.5,      xend = .x - 0.5,\n        y = .y - 0.5, yend = y\n      )\n    }),\n    up = map2(wday_name, week_year, ~ {\n      # n/a if month changes on first day\n      if (.x == 1) return(tibble(.missing = NA))\n      tibble(\n        x = .x - 0.5, xend = x,\n        y = .y - 0.5, yend = .y + 0.5\n      )\n    }),\n    right = map2(wday_name, week_year, ~ {\n      tibble(\n        x = .x - 0.5, xend = 7.5,\n        y = .y + 0.5, yend = y\n      )\n    })\n  )\n\n\nmonth_boundaries\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  day        month  wday_name week_year left             up       right   \n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;ord&gt;      &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&gt;           &lt;list&gt;   &lt;list&gt;  \n1 2019-07-01 July           1         7 &lt;tibble [1 × 1]&gt; &lt;tibble&gt; &lt;tibble&gt;\n2 2019-08-01 August         4         3 &lt;tibble [1 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble&gt; &lt;tibble&gt;\n\n\nThen, I use a quick for loop to add each of these segments to the calendar plot.\n\nfor (boundary in c(\"left\", \"up\", \"right\")) {\n  gcal &lt;- gcal +\n    geom_segment(\n      data = month_boundaries %&gt;% unnest(!!rlang::sym(boundary)),\n      aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),\n      color = \"#999999\",\n      linetype = 2\n    )\n}\n\ngcal"

    "text": "Last updated: 2018-03-05 10:00\ntl;dr: Google searches for “gun control” after the shooting in Parkland, Florida seem to be similar to search trends after other shootings, although it could be different this time.\nA civilized, modern society should be able to function nearly entirely without guns. We should be able to go about our lives without ever thinking about guns. We should be able to go the school, to go to church, to go to the grocery store, to leave our house and move about in the world without ever thinking about guns. Without ever having to worry about a gun, by accident or intention, ending your life or the lives of your loved ones.\nWe face a public health crisis unique to our country alone with respect to gun violence. We are inflicting pain and economic burden on ourselves at a yearly cost of $229 billion – equivalent to the size of Portgual’s economy. It is pointless, devastating, entirely unnecessary and utterly heart breaking.\nI very clearly remember Columbine as an inflection point in education in my childhood, bomb threats and fire drills replacing class time like DVDs replacing VHS. Columbine happened 1,700 miles away from my middle school, but we felt it, even within the bubble of privelege that surrounded my community. I cannot even begin to fathom how today’s children feel the gun violence they see around them.\nIt absolutely breaks my heart that they have to go through this. It breaks my heart that the “adults” in our society can’t get our shit together. It breaks my heart that they have to fight so hard to be heard and protected, that we need them to keep fighting, that we need them to stand up and speak out when we should be comforting them, when we should have done something sooner.\nIn their darkest hours, we are asking too much of them. And yet we need them. How else will this ever change?\nYesterday, Nate Silver put words to our collective hope that this time something is different, that we’re getting closer to #NeverAgain.\nMy first thought was how do you know?. What does the “fade” look like? Clearly, I wasn’t alone as a lot of other people pointed this out in replies.\nI did a quick search and found the gtrendsR package on Github. (Thank you Philippe Massicotte and Dirk Eddelbuettel.) What follows is an analysis of Google Search trends for the term “gun control” before and after other mass shooting events."

The scale of searching is relative to the time period queried. Events such as the Las Vegas Strip, Orlando Night Club, Aurora Theater shootings show how the events caught the attention of the public and led to questions about our gun laws. Other events, such as the Fort Hood Army Base attack seemed not to have caught public or media attention in the same way.\n\nThe above plot highlights search trends around individual mass shooting events, but it’s difficult to assess how strong the response to a particular event is relative to previous events.\nThe approach that I worked out is to use a baseline search term that is relatively constant across the entire period. As I discussed above, I picked \"baseline\" for this role, as it nicely fits the bill. For each query of Google Trends, I also requested search trends for \"baseline\". Then I scaled the \"gun control\" search trends relative to the hits on the baseline search.\nWhat this means is that in the following plot, the search volume for \"gun control\" is shown in “units” of searches for \"baseline\". A value of 10 means there are 10 times more search for \"gun control\", whereas a value of 1 means that the search volumen is roughly equivalent."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On February 3rd, Axios released President Trump’s daily schedule. As in many other areas of his political career, Trump has broken with tradition by hiding his schedule from public view.\nIn addition to a set of re-typed PDF files, Axios also created a Google Spreadsheet containing the president’s schedule and notes about the activities. If you’re interesting in reading about how that task could be accomplished, I highly recommend Maëlle Salmon’s post on rectangling the tables in the PDF files.\nThe leak and subsequent release by Axios provide unique insight into Trump’s daily activities, which are dominated by a large block of time referred to as Executive Time. Reportedly, Trump hated following a strict daily schedule, so former chief-of-staff John Kelly introduced the concept of Executive Time: unstructured time when the president reads watches news, makes phone calls, and writes emails tweets.\nI won’t comment extensively on what these schedules mean—for more on that angle, see reporting from Axios, Vox, Politico and others.\nInstead, I’ll use this post to visualize the president’s work day and tweeting habits and a demonstrate how to use R, plot.ly and the tools of the tidyverse to create interactive and static visualizations to try to make sense of what the president does on a daily basis."

(Note these plots look best on desktop devices.)\nHover over any time slot to view more details about the activity at that time. You can also toggle activity categories — try removing everything except Meetings, Lunches, and Events, it’s unbelievable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView static image of the plot.

On the other hand, I created a number of helper functions and constants that I reused throughout this post, so there’s quite a bit of code and preamble to get to the actual plot making.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(sysfonts)\n\nLoad the Axios Data\n\n# Convert datetime to decimal hour of day\nin_hours &lt;- function(x) {\n  hour(x) + minute(x)/60 + second(x)/60^2\n}\n\nexecutive_categories &lt;- c(\n  \"executive_time\" = \"Executive Time\",\n  \"event\"   = \"Event\",\n  \"lunch\"   = \"Lunch\",\n  \"meeting\" = \"Meeting\",\n  \"no_data\" = \"Unknown\",\n  \"travel\"  = \"Travel\"\n)\n\n# Exec Time Downloaded from http://bit.ly/2Sk9Vj7\nexec_time &lt;-\n  read_csv(\n    here::here(\n      \"_data\", \"trump-exec-time\",\n      \"axios_trump_schedule_2018-11-07--2019-02-02.csv\"\n    ),\n    col_types = cols(.default = col_character())\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Convert time start/end to datetime\n    event_id   = row_number(),\n    time_start = paste(date, time_start),\n    time_end   = paste(date, time_end),\n    time_start = ymd_hm(time_start, tz = \"America/New_York\"),\n    time_end   = ymd_hm(time_end, tz = \"America/New_York\"),\n    time_end   = if_else(time_start &gt; time_end,\n                         time_end + hours(24), time_end),\n    # Recode the activity category with nicer labels\n    top_category = factor(top_category,\n                          levels = names(executive_categories),\n                          labels = executive_categories)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Create label pieces for plotly hover text\n    label_title    = glue(\"&lt;b&gt;{top_category}&lt;/b&gt;\"),\n    has_uniq_title = tolower(top_category) != tolower(listed_title),\n    has_subtitle   = has_uniq_title & !is.na(listed_title),\n    label_subtitle = if_else(has_subtitle,\n                             glue(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;{listed_title}&lt;/em&gt;\"), \"\"),\n    has_location   = !is.na(listed_location),\n    label_location = if_else(has_location,\n                             glue(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;{listed_location}&lt;/em&gt;\"), \"\"),\n    label_time     = glue(\n      \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{strftime(time_start, '%A, %B %e %H:%M')} \",\n      \"to {strftime(time_end, '%H:%M')}\"),\n    has_notes      = !is.na(notes),\n    label_notes    = if_else(has_notes, paste0(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\", notes), \"\"),\n    # Compose final tooltip text\n    label = paste0(label_title, label_subtitle, label_location,\n                   label_time, label_notes)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # truncate any activities that span 8am or 5pm\n    time_start = if_else(\n      in_hours(time_start) &lt; 8 & in_hours(time_end) &gt; 8,\n      floor_date(time_start, \"day\") + hours(8),\n      time_start\n    ),\n    time_end = if_else(\n      in_hours(time_start) &lt; 17 & in_hours(time_end) &gt; 17,\n      floor_date(time_end, \"day\") + hours(17),\n      time_end\n    ),\n    # create 5 minute increments \"inside\" each activity\n    time_inc   = map2(time_start, time_end, seq, by = \"5 mins\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(event_id, time_start, time_end, time_inc,\n         listed_title, top_category, label)\n\nglimpse(exec_time)\n\n\n\nRows: 577\nColumns: 7\n$ event_id     &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17…\n$ time_start   &lt;dttm&gt; 2018-11-07 08:00:00, 2018-11-07 11:00:00, 2018-11-07 11:…\n$ time_end     &lt;dttm&gt; 2018-11-07 11:00:00, 2018-11-07 11:30:00, 2018-11-07 12:…\n$ time_inc     &lt;list&gt; &lt;2018-11-07 08:00:00, 2018-11-07 08:05:00, 2018-11-07 08…\n$ listed_title &lt;chr&gt; \"Executive time\", \"Meeting with the chief of staff\", \"Exe…\n$ top_category &lt;fct&gt; Executive Time, Meeting, Executive Time, Lunch, Executive…\n$ label        &lt;chr&gt; \"&lt;b&gt;Executive Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oval office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wed…\n\n\n\n\nPrepare to Make a Plot\nTo build the plot, I first created several helper functions for the plot labels, scales, and data filtering. I also set the global plot theme, and created a few constants that I used across several plots in this post.\n\nHelper Functions\n\nThe first helper adds \"am\" or \"pm\" to an integer hour for easy-to-read labels on the x-axis time of day.\n\nam_pm &lt;- function(x) {\n  x &lt;- floor(x)\n  y &lt;- paste(x)\n  y[x &lt; 1] &lt;- \"12 am\"\n  y[x &gt; 1 & x &lt; 12] &lt;- paste(y[x &gt; 1 & x &lt; 12], \"am\")\n  y[x == 12] &lt;- \"12 pm\"\n  y[x &gt; 12] &lt;- paste(x[x &gt; 12] - 12, \"pm\")\n  y\n}\n\nam_pm(seq(8, 17, 3))\n\n[1] \"8 am\"  \"11 am\" \"2 pm\"  \"5 pm\" \n\n\nThe second helper function is copied directly from StackOverflow: Reverse datetime (POSIXct data) axis in ggplot, in one of the rare-but-beautiful moments when directly copying and pasting from SO works out perfectly. This gives me a rev_date() transformer function that can be passed to scale_y_continuous(trans = rev_date) to show the y-axis in chronological order with the earliest date starting at the top.\nA third helper function abstracts the code required to filter out the portion of the data set that belongs to the workday, which I use throughout this post. This function is a nice example of how tidyeval can be used for flexible dplyr wrapper functions.\n\nfilter_workday &lt;- function(\n  df,\n  start = hms::hms(0, 0, 8),\n  end = hms::hms(0, 0, 17),\n  start_var = time_start,\n  end_var = time_end\n) {\n  start_var &lt;- rlang::enquo(start_var)\n  end_var &lt;- rlang::enquo(end_var)\n\n  df %&gt;%\n    filter(\n      date(!!start_var) == date(!!end_var),\n      hms::as_hms(!!start_var) &gt;= start,\n      hms::as_hms(!!end_var) &lt;= end\n    )\n}\n\nFinally, another helper function creates the plot caption credits.\n\ncredit_caption &lt;- function(rtweet = FALSE) {\n  paste0(\n    \"\\nData:   Based on White House schedules released by Axios. http://bit.ly/2UGM0fw\",\n    if (rtweet) \"\\n           Tweets collected with {rtweet}. https://rtweet.info\",\n    \"\\nChart: @grrrck\"\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n\nPlot Themes\n\nI used showtext and sysfonts to match the fonts in the plot to the font used on this blog (PT Mono).\n\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"PT Sans\")\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"PT Sans Narrow\")\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"PT Mono\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\nAnd I used hrbrthemes’ excellent theme_ipsum() as my theme’s starting point.\n\ntheme_set(\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(\n    base_family       = \"PT Sans\",\n    base_size         = 20,\n    axis_title_family = \"PT Sans Narrow\",\n    axis_title_size   = 14,\n    axis_text_size    = 12,\n    axis_title_just   = \"c\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title       = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle    = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.margin      = margin(15, 15, 15, 15),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    legend.position  = \"bottom\",\n    legend.key       = element_rect(\n      fill = \"white\", color = \"white\", linewidth = 4),\n    legend.key.width = unit(2, \"cm\"),\n    legend.text      = element_text(size = 9),\n    plot.caption     = element_text(\n      color = \"#85919b\", hjust = 0, size = 12, face = \"plain\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\nPlot Constants\n\nI created a few constants for later reference: one stores date breaks for the time period covered by the Axios schedule, with labels on each Monday; and the other two store the color palette and labels for the executive activity categories. The colors were hand-selected from a picture of the Donald (I was expecting there to be more orange).\n\nplot_date_breaks &lt;- seq(\n  from = ymd_h(\"2018-11-12 0\", tz = \"America/New_York\"),\n  to   = max(exec_time$time_start),\n  by   = \"7 day\"\n)\n\nplot_date_breaks_labels &lt;- strftime(plot_date_breaks, \"%b %e\")\nplot_date_breaks &lt;- as.integer(plot_date_breaks)\n\nevent_type_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"Executive Time\" = \"#445566\",\n  \"Travel\"  = \"#997788\",\n  \"Lunch\"   = \"#7c9393\",\n  \"Meeting\" = \"#b7c6d6\",\n  \"Event\"   = \"#ddbbaa\",\n  \"Unknown\" = \"#d9dde0\")\n\nevent_type_labels &lt;- sub(\" \", \"\\n\", names(event_type_colors))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild the Actual Plot Already!\nFinally, I pulled the schedule data and all of the above pieces together to build the interactive plot.\n\ng &lt;-\n  exec_time %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    date = floor_date(time_start, \"day\"),\n    date = as.integer(date)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter_workday() %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(time_start, time_end), in_hours) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_rect(\n    aes(xmin = time_start,\n        xmax = time_end,\n        ymin = date - 3600 * 12,\n        ymax = date + 3600 * 12,\n        fill = top_category\n    )\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks   = seq(8, 17, 3),\n    limits   = c(8, 17),\n    position = \"top\",\n    labels   = am_pm(seq(8, 17, 3)),\n    expand   = expansion(c(0.025, 0), 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_reverse(\n    # trans  = rev_date,\n    breaks = plot_date_breaks,\n    labels = plot_date_breaks_labels,\n    expand = expansion(c(0.025, 0), 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = event_type_colors,\n    labels = event_type_labels\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"Hour of the Day\", y = NULL, fill = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\n    \"President Trump's Daily Schedule\",\n    \"November 7, 2018 through February 2, 2019\"\n  ) +\n  labs(caption = credit_caption(FALSE)) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1, label.position = \"bottom\")) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(family = \"PT Mono\", size = 10),\n    plot.margin = margin(3, 0, 0, 0, unit = \"line\")\n  )\nplotly::ggplotly(g + aes(text = label), tooltip = \"label\") %&gt;%\n  plotly::layout(xaxis = list(side = \"top\", title = \"\"))\n\nAnd that’s it!

    "text": "The President’s Daily Tweeting Schedule\nDonald Trump tweets about 5.1 tweets per working day within working hours. Why does this number feel so low? Then again, this represents 290 tweets published over 57 workdays and 128 tweets over the 24 weekend days in the same time period. Outside of work hours, the average rises to 8.7 tweets per 24-hour workday, or a total of 546 tweets on workdays and 203 tweets on weekends.\nBelow, each tweet sent by the President is shown as a dot over his private schedule. Hover over a tweet’s dot to read the text of the tweet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView static image of the plot. Expand the section below to learn more about how I gathered tweets from @realDonaldTrump, merged his tweets with the Axios schedules, and added them to the first plot.\nAlso, if you’re interested in exploring the timeline of tweets rendered as they appear on Twitter, Jonathan Sidi created an awesome Shiny app for exploring Trump’s tweets by category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow This Was Made…\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization required the President’s tweets, which I downloaded using the excellent rtweet package. After matching the tweets with their corresponding activity, I modified the previous plot to soften the coloring of the presidential activities and added the tweets to the chart.\n\nDownload the President’s Tweets\nUsing the rtweet package makes downloading the tweets relatively straightforward. I only needed to add a loop to gather tweets beyond Twitter’s timeline API limits and ensure that I have all the tweets from the time period described in the leaked schedules.\n\n# Change to `if (TRUE)` to run\nif (FALSE) {\n  djt &lt;- NULL\n  keep_going &lt;- TRUE\n  while (keep_going) {\n    max_id &lt;- if (!is.null(djt$status_id)) max(as.numeric(djt$status_id))\n    djt.this &lt;- rtweet::get_timeline(\"realdonaldtrump\", n = 3200, max_id = max_id)\n    djt &lt;- bind_rows(djt, djt.this)\n    keep_going &lt;- min(djt$created_at) &gt; lubridate::ymd_h(\"2018-11-07 0\", tz = \"America/New_York\")\n    cat(\"\\nWe have\", nrow(djt), \"tweets...\")\n    Sys.sleep(15)\n  }\n  saveRDS(djt, here::here(\"_data\", \"djt-tweets-2018-09--2019-02.rds\"))\n}\n\n\n\nJoin Tweets with the President’s Schedule\nTo align the tweets with the President’s schedule, I rounded (actually, floored) the time stamp of each tweet down to the nearest 5 minute interval. Then, I joined the tweets to the schedule using the 5 minute intervals I created while importing the schedule (see above).

But how much of the day is spent in each activity group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code…\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to calculate the total time as a percentage of the 8am to 5pm workday spent in each time category. This data frame will be used for several plots.\nOne tricky point is that there are piece of the schedule that are explicitly marked as “Unknown” (or “no data”) in the Axios data, so I calculate the total percent of time spent in other categories and subtract this value from 1 to recover the complete unaccounted-for time.\n\nexec_time_total &lt;-\n  exec_time %&gt;%\n  filter(between(hour(time_start), 8, 17), hour(time_start) &lt; 17) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    date = floor_date(time_start, \"day\"),\n    n = difftime(time_end, time_start, units = \"mins\"),\n    n = as.numeric(n)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date, top_category) %&gt;%\n  summarize(pct = sum(n) / (60 * 9)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  # Get unaccounted time for each date (unknown or unlabelled)\n  nest(-date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    total = map_dbl(data, ~ {\n      filter(., top_category != \"Unknown\") %&gt;%\n        pull(pct) %&gt;%\n        sum()\n    }),\n    unaccounted = 1 - total,\n  ) %&gt;%\n  unnest() %&gt;%\n  spread(top_category, pct, fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Unknown` = unaccounted) %&gt;%\n  select(-total, -unaccounted) %&gt;%\n  gather(\"top_category\", \"pct\", -date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(top_category = factor(top_category, rev(names(event_type_colors))))\n\nexec_time_total %&gt;%\n  arrange(date, desc(pct))\n\n# A tibble: 378 × 3\n   date                top_category      pct\n   &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2018-11-07 00:00:00 Executive Time 0.833 \n 2 2018-11-07 00:00:00 Lunch          0.111 \n 3 2018-11-07 00:00:00 Meeting        0.0556\n 4 2018-11-07 00:00:00 Event          0     \n 5 2018-11-07 00:00:00 Unknown        0     \n 6 2018-11-07 00:00:00 Travel         0     \n 7 2018-11-08 00:00:00 Executive Time 0.5   \n 8 2018-11-08 00:00:00 Meeting        0.222 \n 9 2018-11-08 00:00:00 Lunch          0.111 \n10 2018-11-08 00:00:00 Unknown        0.0833\n# … with 368 more rows\n\n\nThe above tibble contains a summary of time use by day, but the first plot requires a full summary of all days in the schedule.

    "text": "Tweeter In Chief\nAt the point, I was very interested in exploring how Trump’s tweeting relates to his work schedule. The first question to answer is When does he send most of his tweets? And the answer is: primarily on the weekends, during executive time, or before or after work hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Start and end dates of Axios-pubslished schedules\n# which I called `exec_time` for some reason and am sticking with\nexec_time_boundaries &lt;-\n  exec_time %&gt;%\n  summarize(min = min(time_start), max = max(time_end))\n\nexec_time %&gt;%\n  # mutate(event_id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  unnest() %&gt;%\n  filter(time_end != time_inc) %&gt;%\n  full_join(djt_simple, by = \"time_inc\") %&gt;%\n  select(event_id, time_inc, created_at, listed_title, top_category, text) %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    !is.na(text),\n    between(time_inc, exec_time_boundaries$min, exec_time_boundaries$max)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    wday = wday(created_at, abbr = FALSE, week_start = 1),\n    top_category = case_when(\n      !is.na(top_category) ~ paste(top_category),\n      wday &gt; 5 ~ \"Weekend\",\n      between(wday, 1, 5) & hour(created_at) &lt;  6 ~ \"Early Morning (before 6am)\",\n      between(wday, 1, 5) & hour(created_at) &lt;  8 ~ \"Morning (6-8 am)\",\n      between(wday, 1, 5) & hour(created_at) &gt; 17 ~ \"Evening (after 5pm)\",\n      is.na(top_category) ~ \"Unknown\",\n      TRUE ~ paste(top_category))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  count(top_category) %&gt;%\n  arrange(n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(top_category = fct_inorder(top_category)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(top_category, n) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#445566\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0, 5)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +\n  labs(x = \"Activity or Time of Day\",\n       y = paste(\n         \"Total Tweets Sent Between\",\n         strftime(exec_time_boundaries$min, \"%F\"),\n         \"to\",\n         strftime(exec_time_boundaries$max, \"%F\")\n       ),\n       title = \"Trump Tweet Volume by Scheduled Activity\",\n       caption = credit_caption(rtweet = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can get a sense of the timing of Trump’s tweeting activities by looking at the time of day of each tweet and the scheduled activity that’s going on at the time.

Naturally, I wondered if he tends to tweet more or less during the day when he has more executive or travel time available. Similarly does he tweet less when he has more strucured time, i.e. metings, events, or lunches?\nSomewhat unsurprisingly, the number of tweets sent during the workday in only very slightly correlated with the amount of unstructured time on Trump’s calendar. This makes sense: there is very little variation in the amount of the day spent in structured events – it’s never more than half the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code…\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndjt_joined %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  count() %&gt;%\n  rename(tweets = n) %&gt;%\n  left_join(exec_time_total, ., by = \"date\") %&gt;%\n  replace_na(list(tweets = 0)) %&gt;%\n  filter(top_category %in% c(\"Executive Time\", \"Unknown\", \"Travel\", \"Lunch\")) %&gt;%\n  spread(top_category, pct, fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  filter(!Unknown == 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(pct = Unknown + `Executive Time` + Travel + Lunch) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(pct, tweets) +\n  geom_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\",\n    color = event_type_colors[\"Executive Time\"],\n    fill = event_type_colors[\"Unknown\"]\n  ) +\n  geom_point(color = event_type_colors[\"Executive Time\"]) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(10)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Percent of Workday Dedicated to Downtime\\n(Executive Time, Travel, Unknown)\",\n    y = \"Number of Tweets\",\n    title = \"Does Trump Tweet More When He Has More Downtime?\",\n    caption = credit_caption(rtweet = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code…\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndjt_simple %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = floor_date(created_at, \"day\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  count() %&gt;%\n  rename(tweets = n) %&gt;%\n  left_join(exec_time_total, ., by = \"date\") %&gt;%\n  filter(top_category %in% c(\"Meeting\", \"Event\", \"Lunch\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarize(pct = sum(pct), tweets = max(tweets)) %&gt;%\n  filter(pct &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(pct, tweets) +\n  geom_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\",\n    color = event_type_colors[\"Executive Time\"],\n    fill = event_type_colors[\"Unknown\"]\n  ) +\n  geom_point(color = event_type_colors[\"Executive Time\"]) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(10)) +\n  labs(x = \"Percent of Workday Dedicated to Meetings, Lunches, or Events\",\n       y = \"Number of Tweets\",\n       title = \"Does Trump Tweet Less When He Does More \\\"Work\\\"?\",\n       caption = credit_caption(rtweet = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I wanted to explore the emotional valence of Trump’s day-time tweeting. Are his morning tweets angrier or more rant-driven? Are his event-related tweets more positive?\nTo this end, I ran Trump’s tweet text through the NRC sentiment dictionary using get_nrc_sentiment() from the syuzhet package. This function returns an integer score from 0 to 10 for a range of positive and negative emotions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code…\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndjt_sentiment &lt;-\n  djt_joined %&gt;%\n  select(top_category, text) %&gt;%\n  mutate(sentiment = map(text, syuzhet::get_nrc_sentiment)) %&gt;%\n  unnest() %&gt;%\n  gather(emotion, value, -top_category, -text)\n\ndjt_sentiment\n\n# A tibble: 2,950 × 4\n   top_category   text                                             emotion value\n   &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                                            &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Executive Time If the Democrats think they are going to waste … anger       1\n 2 Executive Time In all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be ch… anger       0\n 3 Executive Time According to NBC News, Voters Nationwide Disapp… anger       4\n 4 Executive Time We are pleased to announce that Matthew G.

I wanted to look further into how these tweets were categorized by the sentiment dictionary, but by this point this post is already far too long and has consumed too much of my evenings and weekends, so I’ll save it for another day.\n\nThanks for reading!

    "text": "rstudio::conf(2022) is just around the corner! This year, I’ve been fortunate to be part of the conference program committee, the small group of RStudio people who gather and evaluate talk submissions, make the tough scheduling decisions about the sessions and talks in the conference program, and generally wrangle and herd all the speaker and talk information into the final schedule.\nMy favorite part of the process — apart from seeing all of the wonderful and creative ways our community approaches data science with R (okay, and Python too) — is finding out how many creative ways we use R to manage the conference.

    "text": "Finding Faces\nNow for the most fun of this entire post. After a quick search on r-pkg.org, I found a few packages that provide methods for facial detection; I tried image.libfacedetection first and it worked out so well that I didn’t have to look any further on the list.\nAs it says on the CRAN page, image.libfacedetection is\n\nAn open source library for face detection in images. Provides a pretrained convolutional neural network based on https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection which can be used to detect faces which have size greater than 10x10 pixels.\n\nThe best feature — apart from reliably detecting faces — is that it works really well with magick. The core functionality is all wrapped up in a single function, image.libfacedetection::image_detect_faces(), and the example in the README tells you just about everything you need to know.\nIn short, after reading the image into R with magick::image_read(), you can call image_detect_faces() to find faces in the image. image_detect_faces() returns data about the detected faces, and you can use its plot() method to overlay boxes over the found faces in the image.\n\nlibrary(image.libfacedetection)\nfaces &lt;- all_profiles |&gt; image_detect_faces()\nplot(faces, all_profiles, only_box = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_detect_faces() returns some interesting data about the detected faces:\n\nThe data frame detections indicates the locations of these. This data.frame has columns x, y, width and height as well as a column called confidence. The values of x and y are the top left of the start of the box.\n\n\nfaces\n## $nr\n## [1] 4\n## \n## $detections\n##     x   y width height confidence landmark1_x landmark1_y landmark2_x\n## 1 153  48    43     57         99         158          70         175\n## 2 140 239    43     58         99         150         260         171\n## 3 365  64    33     44         99         373          79         387\n##   landmark2_y landmark3_x landmark3_y landmark4_x landmark4_y landmark5_x\n## 1          68         162          80         162          92         177\n## 2         260         160         272         151         282         168\n## 3          80         377          86         372          94         385\n##   landmark5_y\n## 1          89\n## 2         282\n## 3          95\n##  [ reached 'max' / getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 1 rows ]\n## \n## attr(,\"class\")\n## [1] \"libfacedetection\"\n\nSince we asked for a profile picture, we can reasonably expect that there’s only one person in the image.

We also take another shortcut: since most people will provide a profile image that prominently features their face, we can start by shrinking the smaller side of the image down to match the desired image size.\nThis shortcut keeps us from perfectly framing the person’s face. Sometimes their face is too close to the edge of the picture, and in other cases there may be negative space around their head that will end up in the cropped profile image. I’d argue that this is okay. It keeps our cropping from being too perfect and the final images still retain some of the character of the original photo.\nOur example profile image is 1080px wide and 720px tall, so we’ll resize the image proportionally down to an image with height 600px.\n\nresize_fit &lt;- function(image, size = 600) {\n  info &lt;- image_info(image)\n  size &lt;- min(size, info$width, info$height)\n  image_resize(\n    image,\n    geometry_size_pixels(\n      height = if (info$width &gt;= info$height) size,\n      width = if (info$height &gt; info$width) size\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nWhen applied to our example profile image, we end up with a 900px × 600px image.\n\nresized_profile &lt;-\n  profiles[[3]] |&gt;\n  resize_fit()\n\nresized_profile |&gt; image_info()\n##   format width height colorspace matte filesize density\n## 1   JPEG   900    600       sRGB FALSE        0   72x72\n\nIn the next step, we’ll figure out which 600px horizontal region best covers the person’s face."

There are three cases:\n\nThe point is so close to the start of the range that it we can’t center the point in our width and instead have to start at 0.\nSimilarly, the point might be so close to the end of the range that our crop width lines up with the end. Or, in other words, the crop width starts at range - width.\nOr finally, we can center the point in our crop width, so it should start at point - width/2.\nOh, and there’s an edge case: if the width is greater than or equal to the full range, then the offset is 0, too.\n\nThis logic gives us the following crop_offset() function:\n\ncrop_offset &lt;- function(point, range, width) {\n  # 4. Catch the edge case first\n  if (width &gt;= range) return(0)\n\n  if ((point - width / 2) &lt; 0) {\n    # 1. must start at left edge\n    return(0)\n  }\n  if ((point + width / 2) &gt; range) {\n    # 2. must start at right edge\n    return(range - width)\n  }\n  # 3. enough space on both sides to center width in range\n  point - width / 2\n}\n\nWhich in our example case tells us that we could crop our resized profile image to a 600px square, offset by the following amount in the x direction:\n\noffset &lt;- crop_offset(\n  point = 579,\n  range = 900,\n  width = 600\n)\noffset\n## [1] 279\n\nWe can use magick::image_crop() with the magick::geometry_area() helper function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen this image is used as a profile or avatar picture, it ends up looking much better than the uncropped and uncentered version!\n\n\nThe example profile image cropped and centered to fit a circular avatar image.

Not when to take a break from staring at your screen (that’s also an important skill, especially when you start flailing1), but points at which you pause and evaluate whether the code in front of you is doing what you think it should be doing. In your binary search of the problem space — will my broken code work if I poke this over here — choosing where to draw the boxes around your code is a skill that comes with time and experience.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska\n\n\nSometimes, it’s made harder by experience. Is this bug I’m working on broken because of a local mistake, or is it broken because I’ve installed the latest version of three of this package’s dependencies from GitHub? Is it because I’m using the latest preview version of my IDE? Or is it because I was working on another feature for a package called by this package and I’ve installed my locally dev version of that package and this package is unhappy about that?\nWith experience I’ve gotten better at looking at a problem, drawing a dotted line around a section of code, and finding a way to test whether the bug is inside or outside that line. But I can just as easily get distracted by a false positive and spend too much time testing things that are totally unrelated to the actual problem that I was trying to fix.\nOne of the hardest parts of learning how to program is learning about how to draw these invisible lines. When everything is new, it’s hard to know where to look when something doesn’t work. It’s easy to think of questions that lead you further from the truth or that lead to non-local jumps in logic: rather than differentiating between two possibilities A or B, a beginner will jump from A doesn’t work so the problem must be possibility K.\nOne of the biggest differentiators of experienced programmers from novices is their ability for metacognitive programming. They don’t just think about code in the sense of remembering a few magical commands, but they have a self-awareness of how they think about code. With experience, programmers move more quickly from what if I try this to what could be going on here and how can I test it?\nNot that we don’t resort or fall into flailing. I can’t tell you how many times I get in a fight with my code just before lunch, while having the awareness to say to myself this will be easier if I take a break and eat some food, only to hear the voice on the other shoulder shout keep going, you’re so close, just try this one last thing."

    "text": "A reprex is the answer\nHow do you learn and practice the critical skill of asking your code questions? With a reprex.\nA reprex is a small, reproducible example. Typically, it’s a small little bit of code with a tiny bug. It’s reproducible, meaning that it’s designed to work anywhere for anyone, or at least to work with the minimal number of dependencies. It doesn’t have to be buggy code, it can just be a tiny example.\nAnd it’s a very powerful technique.\nOn the one hand, a reproducible example makes it easier to get help by making it easier for people to help you. For a great introduction to reprexes from this angle, you should definitely watch Sharla Gelfand’s talk make a reprex… please.\nOn the other hand, when you create a reprex you’re practicing the art and science of asking questions of your code. At every iteration you ask yourself: is this part here essential? Is this package really required? Do I need this much data to make my example reproducible, or can I get to the same place with a smaller data set? Helpfully, you get immediate feedback: if you take out too much, your example doesn’t do the thing anymore. This skill of editing and question asking is critical — and it’s why the process of creating a reprex so often leads to a discovery of a solution.\nYou don’t always have to start with a large problem. It can be just as valuable to create a toy problem to play with as you’re learning a new concept or a programming method. It’s easier to tinker and explore when it’s small, just like it’s easier to be confident you understand what the code or method you’re learning are actually doing when that’s the focus of your code.\nSo, the next time you’re flailing, stop and make a reprex. The next time you’re learning a new concept, stop and make a reprex. And the next time you’re teaching beginners how to program, feel free to teach them how to stop and make a reprex2."

You’ll know you aren’t flailing any more when you have a feeling of getting somewhere even when your ideas aren’t panning out — because they’re at least telling you what won’t work.↩︎\nSeriously, teach reprex early. You don’t have to get into the weeds about environments or file paths or other technical details. Learning to program is learning how to understand code; they’ll either learn how to approach problematic code in a systematic way with a reprex, or they’ll learn how to debug their own code in the wild with fewer guard rails and tools.↩︎"

Nothing reveals the shared delusion of time like trying to explain to your children why we moved the clock forward an hour when it means they’ll suddenly need to go to bed while it’s light out or wake up and get ready for school while it’s dark.\nSo in this spirit, I started to wonder: what kind of returns are we getting on our daylight saving? Except, rather than try to directly answer that question — since that’s way too hard — I chose to visualize day light hours to see how they align with the modern work day.\nThe plot below shows the yearly day light schedule for 2022 in Atlanta, GA where I live. We’ll also take a look at the day light schedule in other cities around the world or across the United States. At the end of this post, I’ll share the code I used to make the plot below.\n\n\n  \n  Atlanta, GA. \n\n\n\n\nDate\nSunrise\nSunset\nDaylight\nNon-Work\n\n\n\n\nShortest Day\nDec 21\n7:41 am\n5:38 pm\n9h 56m\n1h 56m\n\n\nLongest Day\nJun 21\n6:32 am\n8:54 pm\n14h 21m\n6h 21m\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s pretty clear from this visualization that in Atlanta, GA, which is very much on the western edge of the U.S. Eastern time zone, year-round standard time is a decent way to live life.

And finally, I used hms::as_hms() to extract the time of day component from each sun event timestamp. The neat thing about the hms class is that while it prints in a readable hours, minutes, seconds format, we can also treat it as an integer number of seconds from midnight. We’ll use this property in just a bit when working on the plot’s axis labels."

We need the sunrise time in one column called starts and a second column with the sunset time in ends. Then we can map these new columns to the ymin and ymax aesthetics, letting geom_ribbon() fill in space between them.\nThe plan of action is to create a new column that I’ll call period where we’ll choose which of these two new columns a timestamp will be moved to. We’ll identify each pair using the morning event label.\nBecause we need pivot_longer() to create two new columns, starts and ends, from our single period column, we’ll first split the table into a list of two tables, one for each period, and then pivot the timestamp column into a new column. Because we’re operating on a list, we’ll use purrr::map() to coordinate this action. Then we can merge the two tables back together with left_join(), using purrr::reduce() to apply that action to the list of pivoted tables.\nAfter that, we’re back in single-table land, and can use mutate() and select() to tweak the final table output to make sure that the morning events are ordered correctly: nautical dawn, then dawn, then sunrise.\n\ntidier_sun_times &lt;-\n  tidy_sun_times %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    period = case_when(\n      str_detect(event, \"[dD]awn|sunrise\") ~ \"starts\",\n      str_detect(event, \"[dD]usk|sunset\") ~ \"ends\"\n    ),\n    pair = recode(\n      event,\n      nauticalDusk = \"nauticalDawn\",\n      sunset = \"sunrise\",\n      dusk = \"dawn\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_split(period) %&gt;%\n  map(pivot_wider, names_from = \"period\", values_from = \"time\") %&gt;%\n  reduce(\n    left_join,\n    by = c(\"date\", \"tz\", \"pair\"),\n    suffix = c(\"_ends\", \"_starts\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    pair = factor(pair, c(\"nauticalDawn\", \"dawn\", \"sunrise\"))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(date, tz, pair, contains(\"starts\"), contains(\"ends\"))\n\ntidier_sun_times\n## # A tibble: 1,098 × 7\n##    date       tz    pair         event_starts starts   event_ends   ends    \n##    &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;time&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;time&gt;  \n##  1 2022-01-01 EST   dawn         dawn         07:18:23 dusk         18:12:28\n##  2 2022-01-01 EST   nauticalDawn nauticalDawn 06:47:27 nauticalDusk 18:43:24\n##  3 2022-01-01 EST   sunrise      sunrise      07:45:47 sunset       17:45:04\n##  4 2022-01-02 EST   dawn         dawn         07:18:35 dusk         18:13:11\n##  5 2022-01-02 EST   nauticalDawn nauticalDawn 06:47:41 nauticalDusk 18:44:05\n##  6 2022-01-02 EST   sunrise      sunrise      07:45:57 sunset       17:45:48\n##  7 2022-01-03 EST   dawn         dawn         07:18:45 dusk         18:13:54\n##  8 2022-01-03 EST   nauticalDawn nauticalDawn 06:47:53 nauticalDusk 18:44:47\n##  9 2022-01-03 EST   sunrise      sunrise      07:46:06 sunset       17:46:33\n## 10 2022-01-04 EST   dawn         dawn         07:18:54 dusk         18:14:39\n## # … with 1,088 more rows"

    "text": "Fill in Metadata\nThe first step is to give your slides all the metadata required to be found via search engines or to look great when shared on social media sites.\nTo do this, I recommend using a small package I wrote called metathis. It’s available on CRAN!\n\ninstall.packages(\"metathis\")\n\nBasically, metathis helps fill out &lt;meta&gt; tags in your HTML document. These tags are used by search engines and social media sites like Twitter and Facebook to describe your page, list the title and author, link to your profile, and show a preview image for the page (we’ll get to this in the next section).\nHere’s a template you can use for your own slides. I’m using a recent presentation as an example, or you can reference the example in the metathis documentation.\n```{r metathis, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(metathis)\nmeta() %&gt;%\n  meta_name(\"github-repo\" = \"gadenbuie/build-your-own-universe\") %&gt;%\n  meta_social(\n    title = \"Build your own universe\",\n    description = paste(\n      \"Scale high-quality research data provisioning with R packages.\",\n      \"Presented at R/Medicine 2020.\"\n    ),\n    url = \"https://build-your-own-universe.netlify.app\",\n    image = \"https://build-your-own-universe.netlify.app/social-card.png\",\n    image_alt = paste(\n      \"Title slide of Build your own universe:\",\n      \"Scale high-quality research data provisioning with R packages,\",\n      \"presented at R/Medicine 2020 by Travis Gerke and Garrick Aden-Buie\"\n    ),\n    og_type = \"website\",\n    og_author = \"Travis Gerke\",\n    twitter_card_type = \"summary_large_image\",\n    twitter_creator = \"@grrrck\",\n    twitter_site = \"@travisgerke\"\n  )\n```\nMost of the arguments are self-explanatory or well-described in ?meta_social. One thing to watch out for is that the image argument must be the full-qualified URL to the image. In other words, the entire URL including the https:// bit, taking into account where the slides will live when you put them online."

    "section": "Create a Social Media Card",
    "text": "Create a Social Media Card\n\nWhy should you add a preview image?\nSocial media cards are the rich link previews you see on websites like Twitter and Facebook. I think it’s worth the extra work to include a preview image for several reasons.\nFirst, it’s much more likely that your link will be seen, especially if your preview image is interesting or visually compelling. Users are more likely to click through and take a look at your slides when they have some idea of what’s on the other side of the link.\nSecond, the preview image is a tiny window into your own personal style. You have no control over the rest of the time line where your link is being shared — your 280 characters look just like everyone else’s — but your preview image is your space to visually communicate your personal style.\nAnd finally, using a preview image means that your crafted message will appear every time your link is shared, not just the first time. A common alternative is to share the link to the slides, but to add an image to share post. This looks great the first time the link is shared, but when someone else shares your slides’ link, they probably won’t go to the trouble of including a screenshot.\nHere are three examples of tweets sharing slides that illustrate the various approaches to link previews.\n\n\n\n\n\n{.lightbox description=“Slide link with limited metadata. (tweet)”}\n\n\n{.lightbox description=“Slide link with a shared image. (tweet)”}\n\n\n{.lightbox description=“Slide link with a preview image and complete metadata. (tweet)”}\n\n\n\n\nTaking a screenshot of your slides\nHow do you create an image for your social media cards? I’m glad you asked! Typically, I like to take a screenshot of the title slide and use that as the preview image.\nTaking a screenshot of your slides is incredibly easy if you’re using Firefox, which has a built-in screenshot feature. On Chrome, you can install an extension, like Nimbus Capture.\nTo take a screenshot, I open my slides in Firefox and select Take a Screenshot from the three-dots menu in the browser URL bar.\n\n\n\nFirefox’s Take a Screenshot menu option\n\n\nThen, don’t click “Save full page” or “Save visible”.

In particular, if you’re targeting Twitter (for sharing with #rstats), you might find that parts of your preview image are cut off if the image width and height aren’t just right.\nIt turns out that the best ratio for share card images on Twitter is 1.91:1.\nSo to get the best image possible, you’ll need to temporarily render your slides with this aspect ratio by changing the ratio to 191:100 in your slides’ YAML header. (It turns out that remarkjs doesn’t like fractional ratio units, hence the need to multiply by 100.)\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    # ... other xaringan options ...\n    nature:\n      ratio: 191:100\nSet the YAML header, render your slides, open in a browser, and take a screenshot.\nIf this sounds like a hassle, it’s because it kind of is. Fortunately, we can use the webshot2 package to automate the entire process. Note webshot2 requires that you have Chrome installed on your computer and is only available from GitHub.\n\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"rstudio/webshot2\")\n\nThen, you can use this little function below to render your slides_rmd in the funky ratio needed for the share image, saving a screenshot of the first slide to path.\n\n#' Screenshot Your Title Slide for Share Image\n#'\n#' Takes a screenshot of your title slide for sharing on Twitter\n#' (and other social media sites).\n#'\n#' @param slides_rmd Your slides file\n#' @param path Path to new share image\nscreenshot_share_image &lt;- function(\n  slides_rmd,\n  path_image = \"share-card.png\"\n) {\n  if (!requireNamespace(\"webshot2\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n    stop(\n      \"`webshot2` is required: \",\n      'remotes::install_github(\"rstudio/webshot2\")'\n    )\n  }\n\n  webshot2::rmdshot(\n    doc = slides_rmd,\n    file = path_image,\n    vheight = 600,\n    vwidth = 600 * 191 / 100,\n    rmd_args = list(\n      output_options = list(\n        nature = list(ratio = \"191:100\"),\n        self_contained = TRUE\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n  path_image\n}\n\nTo use the function, just give it the path to your slides .Rmd and share-card.png will be created in your working directory.\n\nscreenshot_share_image(\"my_slides.Rmd\")"

RStudio addins extend RStudio’s interface with small apps and actions, and you can assign customized keyboard shortcuts to trigger any addin you have installed quickly from the keyboard.\nInstalling an addin isn’t hard — and if you’re looking for new addins, Dean Attali’s addinslist is the place to go. But addins are installed via R packages, so if you want to create your own addin, you’ll have to create a new R package to store your addin. And if you have to create a new R package, you’ll need to think of a name for your R package. But naming is hard, and all the good words starting with or involving the letter R are already taken.\nWhat if all you want to do is run a function from an installed package or a short bit of R code that does something useful and that makes your workflow just a little smoother?\nWhat if you want that function to run whenever you press Control + Alt + Shift + K?\nIt seems like there should be an easier way to do this than to create an R package.\n(Have I convinced you that you also have the same problem I do, or am I the only one?)"

    "section": "Introducing shrtcts",
    "text": "Introducing shrtcts\nshrtcts is a small package I’ve put together with the goal of making it easier to register and manage RStudio addins without having to maintain an R package.\n\nGetting started\nFirst, install shrtcts.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"gadenbuie/shrtcts\")\n\nThen, create a YAML file called .shrtcts.yaml and store it in your home directory1 or in a directory called .config in your home directory.\nThis YAML file holds your shortcuts as a YAML list. Each item looks a lot like the addins.dcf file that is used to register addins in R packages. The only difference is that the Binding entry can be any arbitrary R function or code.\n- Name: Say Something Nice\n  Description: A demo of cool things\n  Binding: praise::praise\n  Interactive: true\nI’m calling this shortcut Say Something Nice and whenever it is triggered it calls praise() from the praise package.\nTo install your shortcut, run add_rstudio_addin() from shrtcts and restart your R session.\n\nshrtcts::add_rstudio_shortcuts()\nrstudioapi::restartSession()\n\nYou can restart your R session by clicking Session &gt; Restart R. Now you should now be able to find the Say Something Nice addin in your addins list!\n\n\n\nShortcut, meet keyboard\n\nAssigning keyboard shortcuts to your addin shortcuts\nOnce you’ve installed your shortcut addins, you can then assign a keyboard shortcut to run your addin. Select Modify Keyboard Shortcuts… from the Tools menu\n\nand then search for your shortcut. Click on the blank space in the Shortcut column and press the keys that will be the your new shortcut. Here, I’m assigning the Say Something Nice addin to Ctrl + Shift + Alt + P.\n\nAfter setting the shortcut, I usually check to make sure my new keyboard shortcut doesn’t collide with a previously installed shortcut by clearing the search and sorting by the shortcut column.\n\n\nA few details to keep in mind about keyboard shortcuts\nThere are a two things to keep in mind about using keyboard shortcuts with your shrtcts shortcuts.\nFirst, if you re-install or update shrtcts, your currently existing keyboard shortcuts should survive the transition. Make sure that you run add_rstudio_addins() again after updating, and make sure that you re-start your R session.\nSecond, the order of your shortcuts in your .shrtcts.yaml file matters, unless you explicitly set the id entry to a number between 1 and 100. This means that it’s a good idea to set the id of shortcuts that you’re going to use with keyboard shortcuts.\n- Name: Say Something Nice\n  Description: A demo of cool things\n  Binding: praise::praise\n  id: 1\n  Interactive: true\n\n\n\nAdding more shortcuts\nTo add more shortcuts, continue adding entries in your .shrtcts.yaml file. If you don’t want to run add_rstudio_shortcuts() every time you update your shortcuts, you can add the following line in your ~/.Rprofile2.\n\nif (interactive() & requireNamespace(\"shrtcts\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n  shrtcts::add_rstudio_shortcuts()\n}\n\nshrtcts comes with a demonstration .shrtcts.yaml file that you can use for inspiration. Print out the example YAML file contents with:\n\nshrtcts::example_shortcuts_yaml()\n\n\n\nShortcuts can be arbitrary R code\nYour shortcut doesn’t need to call a function in a package. In fact, you can create shortcuts that run R code simply by putting the code you want to run in the Binding entry.\nHere’s an example shortcut that picks a number between 0 and 100. (Great for playing what number of am I think of?)\n- Name: I'm thinking of a number...\n  Binding: sample(0:100, 1)\nNotice the binding is just R code (I was thinking of 69, by the way), and the only fields you need to include are the Name and the Binding.\nYour shortcuts don’t need to fit on a single line either. You can use multi-line literal-style YAML blocks for your R code. In other words, add | after Binding and then indent your R code.\nHere’s an example shortcut that I use occasionally to create a temporary markdown file so that I can test some markdown or R code and have the file be thrown away when I exit my R session.\n- Name: New Temporary R Markdown Document\n  Binding: |\n    tmp &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".Rmd\")\n    rmarkdown::draft(\n      tmp,\n      template = \"github_document\",\n      package = \"rmarkdown\",\n      edit = FALSE\n    )\n    rstudioapi::navigateToFile(tmp)\n  Interactive: false"

    "text": "Behind the Scenes\nHow does this all work? shrtcts comes with a minimal addins registry with one addin that browses to the help page ?add_rstudio_addins.\nWhen you run add_rstudio_addins(), shrtcts rewrites it’s own addins registry using your shortcut title and description. It also assigns each shortcut in .shrtcts.yaml to an id from 1 to 100, which correspond to 100 shortcut functions in the shrtcts package. Each addin is wired to one of these functions, so when you run the associated addin shrtcts looks up the correct shortcut in your .shrtcts.yaml file and runs that shortcut.\nThis why you need to run add_rstudio_addins() whenever you add or modify the order of your shortcuts. Whenever this happens, shrtcts has to re-wire the addins registry to make sure everything is connect.\nThis is also why you need to restart your R session for the addins to be seen by RStudio. RStudio only checks for package addins when R starts up, so the R session restart triggers RStudio to refresh the addin registry.\n\nInspiration\nshrtcts was inspired by rsam, the RStudio Addins Manager by @yonicd. There’s a lot that rsam can do — including helping you manage your keyboard shortcuts — and shrtcts is essentially an extension of rsam’s limited liability addins. rsam provides three slots for custom addins that in turn look for specially-named functions defined in the global environment. In the addins menu, these three custom addins appear as lla1, lla2, and lla3. The upside of rsam is that you don’t have to write code in YAML (huge plus!), but the downside is that the names of the addins are fixed.\nshrtcts, on the other hand, rewrites its own addin registry so that you can have customized addin names and descriptions. In both packages, the number of custom addins is limited: rsam provides 3 slots, while shrtcts gives you 100."

Make sure you download it before Nov 12, 2022, 9:46:31 PM\n\nThe archive downloads as a zip file containing a standalone web page — called Your archive.html — for exploring your data. But the real archive lives in the included data/ folder as a bunch of .js files. I’ve copied that data/ directory into my working directory for this post.\n\n\nSetup\nOn the R side, we’ll need the usual suspects: tidyverse and glue.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#&gt; ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ───────────────────────\n#&gt; ✔ dplyr     1.0.10     ✔ readr     2.1.3 \n#&gt; ✔ forcats   0.5.2      ✔ stringr   1.5.0 \n#&gt; ✔ ggplot2   3.4.0      ✔ tibble    3.1.8 \n#&gt; ✔ lubridate 1.9.0      ✔ tidyr     1.2.1 \n#&gt; ✔ purrr     1.0.1      \n#&gt; ── Conflicts ────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n#&gt; ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n#&gt; ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n#&gt; ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(glue)\n\n(I’m using the dev version of tidyverse (1.3.2.9000), which loads lubridate automatically, and the dev version of purrr that is slated to become version 1.0.0.)\nTo read in the data files, I’ll use jsonlite to read the archive JSON data, with a small assist from brio for fast file reading. I’m also going to have some fun with ggiraph for turning static ggplot2 plots into interactive plots.\nFinally, the Twitter archive doesn’t require API access to Twitter, but you can use it to augment the data in the archive. The rtweet package is excellent for this, even though it takes a little effort to get it set up.\n\n\nRead the manifest\nThe data/ folder is surprisingly well structured! There are two key files to help you find your way around the archive. First, the README.txt file explains the structure and layout of the files, and includes descriptions of the data contained in all of the files.\nHere’s how the README describes the account.js data file:\naccount.js\n- email: Email address currently associated with the account if an email address has been provided.\n- createdVia: Client application used when the account was created. For example: “web” if the  account was created from a browser.\n- username: The account’s current @username. Note that the @username may change but the account ID will remain the same for the lifetime of the account.\n- accountId: Unique identifier for the account.\n- createdAt: Date and time when the account was created.\n- accountDisplayName: The account’s name as displayed on the profile.\nThe data/ folder also contains a manifest.js file that can be used to help read the data included in the archive. Let’s start by assuming this file is JSON and reading it in.\n\njsonlite::fromJSON(\"data/manifest.js\")\n#&gt; Error in parse_con(txt, bigint_as_char): lexical error: invalid char in json text.\n#&gt;                                        window.__THAR_CONFIG = {   \"use\n#&gt;                      (right here) ------^\n\nHere we hit our first snag. The archive files are packaged as JSON, but they’re not strictly compliant JSON files; they include some JavaScript to assign JSON objects to the global namespace (called window in the browser). Here’s the data/manifest.js file as an example.\nwindow.__THAR_CONFIG = {\n  // ... data ...\n}\nIf we just remove everything up to the first the { or sometimes [ on the first line, we can turn the data into valid JSON.\n\nlines[1] &lt;- sub(\"^[^{[]+([{[])\", \"\\\\1\", lines[1])\nmanifest &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(lines)\n\nThis worked, but… jsonlite was designed for statistical work, so it transforms the data structure when reading in the JSON. For example, by default it converts arrays that look like JSON-ified data frames into actual data.frames.\n\nmanifest$dataTypes[1:2] |&gt; str()\n#&gt; List of 2\n#&gt;  $ account          :List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ files:'data.frame':    1 obs. of  3 variables:\n#&gt;   .. ..$ fileName  : chr \"data/account.js\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ globalName: chr \"YTD.account.part0\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ count     : chr \"1\"\n#&gt;  $ accountCreationIp:List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ files:'data.frame':    1 obs. of  3 variables:\n#&gt;   .. ..$ fileName  : chr \"data/account-creation-ip.js\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ globalName: chr \"YTD.account_creation_ip.part0\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ count     : chr \"1\"\n\nThat’s often quite helpful! But I find it’s safer, when trying to generalize data reading, to disable the simplification and know for certain that the data strcutre matches the original JSON. For that reason, I tend to disable the matrix and data.frame simplifications and only allow jsonlite to simplify vectors.\nHere’s a quick helper function that includes those setting changes and the first line substitution needed to read the archive JSON files.\n\nread_archive_json &lt;- function(path) {\n  lines &lt;- brio::read_lines(path)\n  lines[1] &lt;- sub(\"^[^{[]+([{[])\", \"\\\\1\", lines[1])\n\n  jsonlite::fromJSON(\n    txt = lines,\n    simplifyVector = TRUE,\n    simplifyDataFrame = FALSE,\n    simplifyMatrix = FALSE\n  )\n}\n\nNow we’re ready to read the manifest again.\n\nmanifest &lt;- read_archive_json(\"data/manifest.js\")\nnames(manifest)\n#&gt; [1] \"userInfo\"    \"archiveInfo\" \"readmeInfo\"  \"dataTypes\"\n\nThe manifest file contains some information about the user and the archive,\n\nstr(manifest$userInfo)\n#&gt; List of 3\n#&gt;  $ accountId  : chr \"47332433\"\n#&gt;  $ userName   : chr \"grrrck\"\n#&gt;  $ displayName: chr \"garrick aden-buie\"\n\nplus details about all of the various data included in the archive, like the data about my account.\n\nstr(manifest$dataTypes$account)\n#&gt; List of 1\n#&gt;  $ files:List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ :List of 3\n#&gt;   .. ..$ fileName  : chr \"data/account.js\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ globalName: chr \"YTD.account.part0\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ count     : chr \"1\"\n\nEach dataType in the manifest points us to a file (or files) in the archive and helpfully tells us how many records are included.\nHere are the data files with the most records.\n\n\nCode: Manifest, Top Records\n\n\nmanifest$dataTypes |&gt;\n  # All data types we can read have a \"files\" item\n  keep(~ \"files\" %in% names(.x)) |&gt;\n  # We keep the files objects but still as a list of lists within a list\n  map(\"files\") |&gt;\n  # Turn the files into tibbles (list of tibbles within a list)\n  map_depth(2, as_tibble) |&gt;\n  # Then combine the files tables for each item keeping track of the file index\n  map(list_rbind, names_to = \"index\") |&gt;\n  # And finally combine files for all items\n  list_rbind(names_to = \"item\") |&gt;\n  mutate(across(count, as.integer)) |&gt;\n  select(-globalName, -index) |&gt;\n  slice_max(count, n = 15) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable(\n    format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"),\n    table.attr = 'class=\"table\"',\n    format = \"html\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitem\nfileName\ncount\n\n\n\n\nlike\ndata/like.js\n11,773\n\n\nfollower\ndata/follower.js\n9,030\n\n\ntweetHeaders\ndata/tweet-headers.js\n6,225\n\n\ntweets\ndata/tweets.js\n6,225\n\n\nipAudit\ndata/ip-audit.js\n3,787\n\n\nfollowing\ndata/following.js\n1,519\n\n\ncontact\ndata/contact.js\n645\n\n\nlistsMember\ndata/lists-member.js\n254\n\n\nblock\ndata/block.js\n242\n\n\nadImpressions\ndata/ad-impressions.js\n173\n\n\nadEngagements\ndata/ad-engagements.js\n171\n\n\ndirectMessageHeaders\ndata/direct-message-headers.js\n97\n\n\ndirectMessages\ndata/direct-messages.js\n97\n\n\nuserLinkClicks\ndata/user-link-clicks.js\n67\n\n\nconnectedApplication\ndata/connected-application.js\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading the account data file\nFor a first example, let’s read the data/account.js archive file. We start by inspecting the manifest, where manifest$dataTypes$account tells us which files hold the account data and how many records are in each.\n\nmanifest$dataTypes$account |&gt; str()\n#&gt; List of 1\n#&gt;  $ files:List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ :List of 3\n#&gt;   .. ..$ fileName  : chr \"data/account.js\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ globalName: chr \"YTD.account.part0\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ count     : chr \"1\"\n\nHere there’s only one file containing a single account record: data/account.js. Inside that file is a small bit of JavaScript. Like the manifest, it’s almost JSON, except that it assigns the JavaScript object to window.YTD.account.part0.\n\nwindow.YTD.account.part0 = [\n  {\n    \"account\" : {\n      \"email\" : \"my-email@example.com\",\n      \"createdVia\" : \"web\",\n      \"username\" : \"grrrck\",\n      \"accountId\" : \"47332433\",\n      \"createdAt\" : \"2009-06-15T13:21:50.000Z\",\n      \"accountDisplayName\" : \"garrick aden-buie\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nAnd again, if we clean up the first line, this is valid JSON that we can read in directly with jsonlite.\n\naccount &lt;- read_archive_json(\"data/account.js\")\nstr(account)\n#&gt; List of 1\n#&gt;  $ :List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ account:List of 6\n#&gt;   .. ..$ email             : chr \"my-email@example.com\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ createdVia        : chr \"web\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ username          : chr \"grrrck\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ accountId         : chr \"47332433\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ createdAt         : chr \"2009-06-15T13:21:50.000Z\"\n#&gt;   .. ..$ accountDisplayName: chr \"garrick aden-buie\"\n\nThis leads us to our first fun fact: I created my Twitter account on June 15, 2009, which means that I’ve been using Twitter (on and off) for 13.6 years. That’s 4,981 days of twittering!\n\n\nRead any archive item\nLet’s generalize what we learned into a few helper functions we can reuse. I’ve placed everything into a single code block so that you can copy and paste it into your R session or script to use it right away.\n\n#' Read the Twitter Archive JSON\n#'\n#' @param path Path to a Twitter archve `.js` file\nread_archive_json &lt;- function(path) {\n  lines &lt;- brio::read_lines(path)\n  lines[1] &lt;- sub(\"^[^{[]+([{[])\", \"\\\\1\", lines[1])\n\n  jsonlite::fromJSON(\n    txt = lines,\n    simplifyVector = TRUE,\n    simplifyDataFrame = FALSE,\n    simplifyMatrix = FALSE\n  )\n}\n\n#' Read an twitter archive data item\n#'\n#' @param manifest The list from `manifest.js`\n#' @param item The name of an item in the manifest\nread_twitter_data &lt;- function(manifest, item) {\n  manifest$dataTypes[[item]]$files |&gt;\n    purrr::transpose() |&gt;\n    purrr::pmap(\\(fileName, ...) read_archive_json(fileName))\n}\n\n#' Simplify the data, if possible and easy\n#'\n#' @param x A list of lists as returned from `read_twitter_data()`\n#' @param simplifier A function that's applied to each item in the\n#'   list of lists and that can be used to simplify the output data.\nsimplify_twitter_data &lt;- function(x, simplifier = identity) {\n   x &lt;- purrr::flatten(x)\n   item_names &lt;- x |&gt; purrr::map(names) |&gt; purrr::reduce(union)\n   if (length(item_names) &gt; 1) return(x)\n\n   x |&gt;\n    purrr::map(item_names) |&gt;\n    purrr::map_dfr(simplifier)\n}\n\nQuick recap: to use the functions above, load your archive manifest with read_archive_json() and then pass it to read_twitter_data() along with an item name from the archive. If the data in the archive item is reasonably structured, you can call simplify_twitter_data() to get a tidy tibble1.\n\nmanifest &lt;- read_archive_json(\"data/manifest.js\")\naccount &lt;- read_twitter_data(manifest, \"account\")\n\nsimplify_twitter_data(account)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 6\n#&gt;   email              creat…¹ usern…² accou…³ creat…⁴ accou…⁵\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  \n#&gt; 1 my-email@example.… web     grrrck  473324… 2009-0… garric…\n#&gt; # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​createdVia, ²​username,\n#&gt; #   ³​accountId, ⁴​createdAt, ⁵​accountDisplayName\n\n\n\n\nExample: my followers\nLet’s use this on another archive item to find the earliest Twitter adopters among my followers.\n\n# These tables are wide, you may need to scroll to see the preview\noptions(width = 120)\n\nfollowers &lt;-\n  read_twitter_data(manifest, \"follower\") |&gt;\n  simplify_twitter_data()\n\nThen we can arrange the rows of followers by accountId as a proxy for date of account creation.\n\nearly_followers &lt;-\n  followers |&gt;\n  arrange(as.numeric(accountId)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 11)\n\n# Top 11 earliest followers\nearly_followers\n#&gt; # A tibble: 11 × 2\n#&gt;    accountId userLink                                      \n#&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                         \n#&gt;  1 1496      https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=1496  \n#&gt;  2 11309     https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=11309 \n#&gt;  3 37193     https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=37193 \n#&gt;  4 716213    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=716213\n#&gt;  5 741803    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=741803\n#&gt;  6 755726    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=755726\n#&gt;  7 774234    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=774234\n#&gt;  8 787219    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=787219\n#&gt;  9 799574    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=799574\n#&gt; 10 860921    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=860921\n#&gt; 11 944231    https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=944231\n\n\nAs you can see, some parts of the Twitter archive include the barest minimum amount of data. Thankfully, we can still use rtweet to gather additional data about these users.

We can read them in the same way that we imported accounts and followers with read_twitter_data(), but for now we won’t simplify them.\nTo see why, let’s take a look at a single tweet. The file of tweets (outer list, [[1]]) contains an array (inner list, e.g. [[105]]) of tweets (named item, $tweet). Here’s that example tweet:\n\n# Tweets are a list of a list of tweets...\ntweet &lt;- read_twitter_data(manifest, \"tweets\")[[1]][[105]]$tweet\nstr(tweet, max.level = 2)\n#&gt; List of 16\n#&gt;  $ edit_info         :List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ initial:List of 4\n#&gt;  $ retweeted         : logi FALSE\n#&gt;  $ source            : chr \"&lt;a href=\\\"https://mobile.twitter.com\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"&gt;Twitter Web App&lt;/a&gt;\"\n#&gt;  $ entities          :List of 5\n#&gt;   ..$ user_mentions:List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ urls         :List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ symbols      : list()\n#&gt;   ..$ media        :List of 1\n#&gt;   ..$ hashtags     :List of 1\n#&gt;  $ display_text_range: chr [1:2] \"0\" \"236\"\n#&gt;  $ favorite_count    : chr \"118\"\n#&gt;  $ id_str            : chr \"1276198597596459018\"\n#&gt;  $ truncated         : logi FALSE\n#&gt;  $ retweet_count     : chr \"33\"\n#&gt;  $ id                : chr \"1276198597596459018\"\n#&gt;  $ possibly_sensitive: logi FALSE\n#&gt;  $ created_at        : chr \"Thu Jun 25 17:00:30 +0000 2020\"\n#&gt;  $ favorited         : logi FALSE\n#&gt;  $ full_text         : chr \"Thanks to prodding from @dsquintana, I added `include_tweet()` to {tweetrmd}.

In 2018 and 2019 you can see my baseline usage pick up considerably at the start of the year — the effects of a lot of tweeting and networking during rstudio::conf. Since 2019, my usage has been fairly stable; I typically send between 50 and 100 tweets a month.

    "text": "Advertising info\nThe last thing I want to dive into is a part of the archive that includes information about Twitter’s perception of you. Or more importantly how they see you in terms of advertising.\n\nImpressions and engagements\nThere are two key items in the archive: ad impressions and engagements. All ads on Twitter are actually tweets that are promoted into your view because an advertiser has paid for Twitter to show you a tweet you wouldn’t otherwise see.\nAn impression is a promoted tweet you see in your timeline or in tweet replies, but you don’t interact with the tweet. An engagement is a tweet that you click on or interact with in some way. The definitions (included in the details below) are hazy — I’m fairly certain from looking at my data that some tweets are “engaged with” simply by being visible on my screen for a longer period of time. (In other words, I’m certain I haven’t actively engaged with as many tweets as are highlighted below.)\nThe ads data items are imported separately and have a pretty wild nested structure. I used a lot of tidyr’s tidyr::unnest() and my newest favorite function, unnest_wider().\n\n\nCode: ad_impressions\n\n\nad-impressions.js - ad: Promoted Tweets the account has viewed and any associated metadata. - deviceInfo: Information about the device where the impression was viewed such as its ID and operating system. - displayLocation: Location where the ad was viewed on Twitter. - promotedTweetInfo: Information about the associated tweet such as unique identifier, text, URLs and media when applicable. - advertiserInfo: Advertiser name and screen name. - matchedTargetingCriteria: Targeting criteria that were used to run the campaign. - impressionTime: Date and time when the ad was viewed.\n\n\nad_impressions &lt;-\n  read_twitter_data(manifest, \"adImpressions\") |&gt;\n  simplify_twitter_data() |&gt;\n  unnest(adsUserData) |&gt;\n  unnest(adsUserData) |&gt;\n  unnest_wider(adsUserData) |&gt;\n  unnest_wider(c(deviceInfo, promotedTweetInfo, advertiserInfo)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    matchedTargetingCriteria = map(matchedTargetingCriteria, map_dfr, identity),\n    across(impressionTime, ymd_hms)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode: ad_engagements\n\n\nad-engagements.js - ad: Promoted Tweets the account has engaged with and any associated metadata. - engagementAttributes: Type of engagement as well as date and time when it occurred.\n\n\nad_engagements &lt;-\n  read_twitter_data(manifest, \"adEngagements\") |&gt;\n  simplify_twitter_data() |&gt;\n  unnest(adsUserData) |&gt;\n  unnest(adsUserData) |&gt;\n  unnest_wider(adsUserData) |&gt;\n  mutate(across(engagementAttributes, map, map_dfr, identity)) |&gt;\n  unnest_wider(impressionAttributes) |&gt;\n  # now the same as the impressions\n  unnest_wider(c(deviceInfo, promotedTweetInfo, advertiserInfo)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    matchedTargetingCriteria = map(matchedTargetingCriteria, map_dfr, identity),\n    across(impressionTime, ymd_hms)\n  )\n\n\nOnce you have the impressions and engagements tables, you can combine them together with purrr::list_rbind.\n\nads &lt;-\n  list(\n    impression = ad_impressions,\n    engagement = ad_engagements\n  ) |&gt;\n  list_rbind(names_to = \"type\")\n\nads\n#&gt; # A tibble: 8,599 × 16\n#&gt;    type       osType devic…¹ devic…² displ…³ tweetId tweet…⁴ urls   media…⁵ adver…⁶ scree…⁷ matche…⁸ impressionTime     \n#&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;list&gt;   &lt;dttm&gt;             \n#&gt;  1 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 154910… \"When … &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  Chevro… @chevr… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 14:03:09\n#&gt;  2 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 155557… \"Tune … &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;NULL&gt;  Walmart @Walma… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 14:08:07\n#&gt;  3 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 155465… \"Meet … &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  Anker   @Anker… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 14:04:17\n#&gt;  4 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 155598… \"This … &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   KESIMP… @KESIM… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 10:54:28\n#&gt;  5 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… TweetC… 155507… \"🎁🎁G… &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  Webull  @Webul… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 10:57:56\n#&gt;  6 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 151472… \"#1 is… &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  Financ… @finan… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 10:56:19\n#&gt;  7 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… TweetC… 155507… \"🎁🎁G… &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  Webull  @Webul… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 10:56:57\n#&gt;  8 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 155481… \"Mick.… &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  EPIX i… @EPIXHD &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 03:33:23\n#&gt;  9 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 155407… \"Watch… &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  Paper … @HowLi… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 03:34:51\n#&gt; 10 impression Ios    2eVW2/… iPhone… Timeli… 155512… \"Wreck… &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;  Mill G… @Mill_… &lt;tibble&gt; 2022-08-08 03:25:08\n#&gt; # … with 8,589 more rows, 3 more variables: publisherInfo &lt;list&gt;, promotedTrendInfo &lt;list&gt;,\n#&gt; #   engagementAttributes &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​deviceId, ²​deviceType, ³​displayLocation, ⁴​tweetText,\n#&gt; #   ⁵​mediaUrls, ⁶​advertiserName, ⁷​screenName, ⁸​matchedTargetingCriteria\n\n\nThe downside of the ads data is that it only includes the last three-ish months.

    "text": "xaringan ❤️ CSS\nOver the last few years, I’ve built many presentations with xaringan. There are a lot of things to love about xaringan, but one thing I’ve noticed is that xaringan presentations can be a gateway into the world of web development.\nIf you’ve worked with R Markdown to create a report or blog or website to share online, you’ve probably encountered a few stylistic things you’ve wanted to change. These changes tend to be small, like choosing a new font family or changing the color of links. If you don’t like the look of your report, there are lots of themes to choose from in rmarkdown, or in other packages like prettydocs, rmdformats, or cleanrmd.\nxaringan is a little different. Slides are a visual medium. You probably have an idea of how you want your slides to look as you work on them.\nYou can get really far with plain markdown using the few little extras that xaringan provides, but at a certain point in the process of transferring your vision of your talk to the screen, you’ve probably said, out loud and not without a slight hint of frustration: I just want that thing to go right there.\nIn point-and-click software, this is where you’d spend some time dragging text and images around or digging through menus to make your slides look awesome. In xaringan, your slides are web page, so we instead need to turn to CSS to style our slides. I’m not going to say that one method is necessarily better than the other, just that I personally love writing code and I actually enjoy CSS. I might be weird in that respect, but since you’re still reading this I’m guessing you are too.\nThis is why I love xaringan. Each slide is a small, self-contained web design project. The constraints are well-defined: you aren’t building an entire website. You don’t have to make an app or think about a user interface. You just need to make this slide look great.\nThere are two advantages of using xaringan and CSS for our slides that I think are important. First, knowing CSS is useful in more places than just making slides. Many of the things I’ve designed for a presentation have been useful in other areas of my life as an R Markdown user and person who puts things on the internet for others to enjoy.\nSecond, while CSS can be daunting to learn, the stakes are relatively low with xaringan. You don’t need to know everything about CSS or web development. When you create a new slide, you only need to worry about the things you’re going to put in that slide. You don’t have to think about laying out an entire web page. And as long as you slides look good when you present them, then your job was well done.\nThis is why I see xaringan as a playground for trying new things. It sets you up to play with CSS, to learn something new, and to get quick, immediate feedback. Plus, it feels good to make things that look great and to share them with the world!\nNot only that, xaringan has a few tricks up its sleeve. Catch the talk or wait for the next post in this series to learn more!"

    "text": "What does xaringanthemer do?\nxaringanthemer works hand-in-hand with xaringan, the R package that turns your R Markdown into beautiful HTML slides rendered as web pages using the remarkjs library.\nxaringan slides tend to look like the slides below, and, by default, xaringan uses the default slide theme from remarkjs.\n\nxaringan does come with a collection of user-contributed themes to choose from, but customizing any xaringan slide theme requires working with CSS and learning which CSS rules apply to each element in the slides.\nEven if you love CSS, it can still be difficult and time-consuming to set up your slides to use a consistent color palette or custom fonts.\nThe magic of xaringanthemer is that it grants you the power to quickly set up a complete slide theme, starting from only one or two color choices. You pick how these color choices are applied by choosing from a collection of style_ functions, and you can tweak the default color choices easily by providing alternative values for many theme parameters.\n\n\n\n\nThese slides were styled using the style_duo_accent() function, which applied my primary color and my secondary color consistently throughout the slide theme.\nYou can also easily use fonts from Google Fonts by using the google_font() helper. I used eye-catching fonts in this example that I probably wouldn’t use in real life (the default fonts used by xaringanthemer are much more readable).\nHere’s the complete code chunk that I used in my slides.Rmd file to create the example above.\n```{r xaringan-themer, include=FALSE}\nstyle_duo_accent(\n  primary_color = \"#035AA6\",        # blue\n  secondary_color = \"#03A696\",      # sea green\n  header_font_google = google_font(\"Amatic SC\"),\n  text_font_google = google_font(\"Crete Round\"),\n  header_h1_font_size = \"3.5rem\",\n  header_h2_font_size = \"2.75rem\"\n)\n```\nThe slide style functions come in a few flavors. Styles derived from two color choices are prefixed with style_duo_. Slide themes generated from a single color use the style_mono_ prefix. There are also two complete styles based on the solarized color palette: style_solarized_light() and style_solarized_dark(). And finally, you can use the style_xaringan() base theme function directly, which starts from the default xaringan theme.\nAll of the style_ functions write a CSS file containing your complete slide theme. By default, the file is called xaringan-themer.css and you can create your CSS file in a separate R script or you can include the style-generating code in your slides with a chunk like the one above.\nIn either case, in order for your slides to use your new theme, you need to modify the css argument of xaringan::moon_reader in the YAML header of your slides.\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: xaringan-themer.css\nThat’s xaringanthemer in a nutshell! You can learn more about the features in the package below, or by visiting pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer."

    "section": "New Features",
    "text": "New Features\nThere are quite a lot of new features in version 0.3.0 that I’m very excited to share with you.\n\nConsistent API with style functions\nThis package has been on GitHub for a couple of years, and thank you to everyone who tested and contributed to the development over the years.\nIf you’ve used the GitHub version before, the API has changed slightly, but there should not have been any breaking changes. In short, all of the files that write CSS, for example the functions previouslly called duo_accent() or write_xaringan_theme(), are now prefixed with style_, e.g. style_duo_accent() and style_xaringan().\n\n\nPowered by CSS variables\nxaringanthemer does much of the work on the R side to prepare the theme, but nearly all of the properties of your theme are stored in CSS variables (or custom properties). This makes it possible to re-use colors from your theme, either in custom CSS or as arguments to the style function parameters.\nWhenever a theme parameter is stored in a CSS variable, the documentation of the associated argument in the style function will tell you what CSS variable name is used. For example, the link_color argument is made available in the CSS as var(--link-color).\nIn general, argument names are converted from snake_case_names to kebab-case-names.\n\n\nSetting additional colors\nIf you’ve spent a lot of time picking out a color palette, or if you’re using a corporate color palette, you’ll likely have more than just two colors that you want to use, and possibly not just in the components of your theme.\nThe markdown syntax used by xaringan (actually remarkjs in this case) allows you to apply a class to text using syntax like this: .class[ ... ]\nBuilding on the use of CSS variables, xaringanthemer helps you add these additional colors to your theme. Using the colors argument, you can specify a vector of named colors.\n\nstyle_xaringan(\n  colors = c(\n    red = \"#f34213\",\n    purple = \"#3e2f5b\",\n    orange = \"#ff8811\",\n    green = \"#136f63\",\n    white = \"#FFFFFF\",\n  )\n)\n\nThe color names are then used in three places. Using the red color as an example, xaringanthemer adds\n\na CSS variable var(--red) that use anywhere in custom CSS\na .red class to set color: var(--red)\na .bg-red class setting background-color: var(--red).\n\nThe named color and background classes are then easy to use in xaringan. Slide text like this\nThis **.red[simple]** .white.bg-purple[demo]\n_.orange[shows]_ the colors .green[in action].\nwill be rendered in HTML as\n\nThis simple demo shows the colors in action.\n\n\n\nMatching ggplot2 themes\nAt this point your slides look a m a z i n g, but your ggplot2 plots stick out like a sore thumb with their sad shades of gray.\nYou want your data visualizations to have the same level of visual appeal as your hand-crafted slide theme, and xaringanthemer can help! I’ll quickly cover some of the new features for styling ggplots here, and you can learn more in the ggplot2 Themes vignette.\n\ntheme_xaringan()\nxaringanthemer provides a ggplot2 theme that knows the styles used in your slides: theme_xaringan(). Let’s start with a basic, typical ggplot2 plot of fuel efficiency of cars using the ggplot2::mpg dataset. You only need to add + theme_xaringan() to give your plot a makeover.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ng_base &lt;- ggplot(mpg) +\n  aes(hwy, cty) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Highway MPG\", y = \"City MPG\", title = \"Fuel Efficiency\")\n\n# Basic plot with default theme\ng_base\n\n\n\n\n\n# Fancy slide-matching themed plot\ng_base + theme_xaringan()\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic ggplot2 plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA theme_xaringan() ggplot\n\n\n\ntheme_xaringan() matches the colors used in your slides to the plot and axis titles (slide heading color) and axis tick labels and default text geometries (slide text color). It also uses the showtext by Yixuan Qiu to match the fonts used in your slides — this feature works particularly well when you use fonts from Google Fonts. theme_xaringan() also sets the default color, fill and text family aesthetics of many ggplot2 geoms, changing, for example, the color of points to match the primary slide color.\nOur theme_xaringan() themed plot would fit right in on just about any slide in the slide deck we made with style_duo_accent() above, except for our inverse-styled slides…\n\n\ntheme_xaringan_inverse()\nIn xaringan, inverse slides provide a nice way to visually break up your presentation. You can create them using the inverse class:\n---\nclass: inverse\n\n&lt;!-- slide content --&gt;\nxaringanthemer also provide a ggplot2 theme for these slides as well: theme_xaringan_inverse().\n\n# theme_xaringan() on the left,\ng_base + theme_xaringan()\n\n\n# theme_xaringan_inverse() on the right\ng_base + theme_xaringan_inverse()\n\n\n\n\n\ntheme_xaringan()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntheme_xaringan_inverse()\n\n\n\n\n\nMatching color and fill scales\nTo give your plots a little more visual appeal, xaringanthemer includes custom color and fill scales based on the primary slide color. This feature uses colorspace::sequential_hcl() from the colorspace package.\nThe scale functions all follow the naming pattern scale_xaringan_&lt;aes&gt;_&lt;data_type&gt;(), where &lt;aes&gt; is replaced with either color or fill and &lt;data_type&gt; is one of discrete or continuous. For colors scales matching the inverse slide style, set inverse = TRUE. Occasionally, you may want to use a different primary color to generate the color or fill scale using the color argument.\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill = ..count..), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Count\", title = \"Diamond Cut Quality\") +\n  theme_xaringan() +\n  scale_xaringan_fill_continuous()\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill = ..count..), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Count\", title = \"Diamond Cut Quality\") +\n  theme_xaringan_inverse() +\n  scale_xaringan_fill_continuous(color = \"#F2B155\")\n\n\n\n\n\nscale_xaringan_fill_continuous()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom color with scale_xaringan_fill_continuous()\n\n\n\n\n\nThree ways to use theme_xaringan()\nIn what is likely the most common scenario, theme_xaringan() learns the slide styles when you use any of the style functions in your slides’ source code.\nAlternatively, you may want to create your CSS files in another process or to use a xaringanthemer CSS file that you share between presentations. In these cases, theme_xaringan() will find the CSS file if it’s in the same folder or a subdirectory of the folder containing your slides source .Rmd. If you have multiple CSS files, or your CSS file is stored elsewhere, you can use the css_file argument to tell theme_xaringan() which file to use. This also means that you can easily match the plots in other R Markdown reports or webpages with theme_xaringan() to the styles used in your presentations by point css_file to the styles used in your slides.\nFinally, you can create themes without calling a style function or a CSS file using the theme_xaringan_base() function. This theme function can be used for complete ggplot2 themes, including Google Fonts. (Note that the text_font and title_font arguments can take a google_font() in all theme_xaringan_ functions.)\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = \"Diamond Cut Quality\") +\n  ylim(0, 25000) +\n  theme_xaringan_base(\n    title_font = google_font(\"Merriweather\", 800),\n    title_font_size = 20,\n    text_font = google_font(\"PT Sans\"),\n    text_font_size = 16,\n    background_color = \"#FFFFFF\",\n    text_color = \"#444444\",\n    accent_color = \"#002B36\",\n  ) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\nA plot with theme_xaringan_base() styled to match this blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning more about ggplot2 themes\nTo learn more about the ggplot2 themes, you can reference the ggplot2 themes vignette online or with vignettes(\"ggplot2-themes\").\n\n\n\nOther new things\nThere are a few other new features that are worth a quick mention.\n\nHeader background\nIf you like the metropolis theme in xaringan — ported from the classic beamer theme by Patrick Schratz who has a demo slide deck on his site — then you might like the header background feature that brings the title bar background to any xaringan presentation.\n\n\n\nSlides with class: header_background\n\n\nThe background is applied to the first level-1 heading on the slide — either &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt; or # Title. There are two modes to the header background: auto and manual.\nManual mode is the default, meaning that for any xaringanthemer slides you can enable the header background using the header_background slide class:\n---\nclass: header_background\n\n# Title with a background\n\n&lt;!-- slide content --&gt;\nAuto mode is invoked by setting header_background_auto = TRUE in the style functions which makes the first level-1 heading of all normal slides into title background. In auto mode, you can disable the header background manually by using class: normal. The header background isn’t applied to title or inverse slides, slides where the text is aligned middle or bottom, or slides with the normal class.\n\n\nNew default fonts\n\n\n\n\nWhile the default xaringan fonts are eye-catching and interesting when you first see them, I personally think that they don’t work well in low-visibility settings, like presentations made in person. xaringanthemer therefore uses a different set of default fonts: Cabin for headings and Noto Sans for body text.\n\n\nA Cabin in the Clearing\n\n\nPack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes.\n\n\nThese fonts are easier to read on screens and at a distance during presentations, and they support a wide variety of languages and weights. Another reason for the change is that the xaringan (remarkjs) default body font, Droid Serif, is no longer officially included in Google Fonts."

For your current R sessions, you can use the Set Default Light Theme to Current addin (or the corresponding dark theme addin), or you can call the set_theme_light() or set_theme_dark() functions:\n# Set current theme to default light or dark theme\nrsthemes::set_theme_light()\nrsthemes::set_theme_dark()\n\n# Set a specific theme to default light or dark theme\nrsthemes::set_theme_light(\"One Light {rsthemes}\")\nrsthemes::set_theme_dark(\"One Dark {rsthemes}\")\nTo create a list of your favorite themes, you can use set_theme_favorite().\n# Add current theme to your list of favorites\nrsthemes::set_theme_favorite()\n\n# Add a list of themes to your favorites\nrsthemes::set_theme_favorite(\n  c(\"GitHub {rsthemes}\", \"One Light {rsthemes}\", \"One Dark {rsthemes}\")\n)\nThese functions only save your preferences for the current R session. To set these defaults for all R sessions, add your preferences to your ~/.Rprofile. (You can use usethis::edit_r_profile() to quickly open your ~/.Rprofile for editing.)\n# ~/.Rprofile\nif (interactive()) {\n  rsthemes::set_theme_light(\"GitHub {rsthemes}\")\n  rsthemes::set_theme_dark(\"Fairyfloss {rsthemes}\")\n  rsthemes::set_theme_favorite(\n    c(\"GitHub {rsthemes}\", \n      \"One Light {rsthemes}\", \n      \"One Dark {rsthemes}\")\n  )\n}\nYou can also set the following global options directly.\n# ~/.Rprofile\noptions(\n  rsthemes.theme_light = \"Nord Snow Storm {rsthemes}\",\n  rsthemes.theme_dark = \"Nord Polar Night Aurora {rsthemes}\",\n  rsthemes.theme_favorite = paste(\"One\", c(\"Light\", \"Dark\"), \"{rsthemes}\")\n)\n\n\nToggle Your Favorite Themes\nUse the Next Favorite Theme addin to walk through your list of favorite themes. Use the Modify Keyboard Shortcuts… dialog in the Tools menu of RStudio to create a keyboard shortcut to make it easy to quickly switch themes — I use Ctrl+ Alt + N. You can also manually call use_theme_favorite() to use the next theme in the your favorites list.\nEach time you run the addin, RStudio switches to the next theme in your favorites list. This is great if you have a few themes that you use in various contexts. For example, I have my personal favorite themes plus a few themes that work well during class or presentation sessions.\n\n\nAutomatic or Manual Light/Dark Mode\nUse the Toggle Dark Mode addin to switch between your default light and dark themes. You can even set a keyboard shortcut in RStudio — I used Ctrl + Alt + D — to toggle dark mode.\nYou can also automatically choose the dark or light theme by time of day, using the included Auto Choose Dark or Light Theme addin, which requires that you’ve set your preferred light/dark themes (see above).\nIf you would like to automatically choose the dark or light theme by time of day during each new session, you can call rsthemes::use_theme_auto() in your ~/.Rprofile. For best results, use the following template in your ~/.Rprofile to declare your preferred dark and light themes and to choose the correct style when your R session reloads.\nif (interactive() && requireNamespace(\"rsthemes\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n  # Set preferred themes if not handled elsewhere..\n  rsthemes::set_theme_light(\"One Light {rsthemes}\")  # light theme\n  rsthemes::set_theme_dark(\"One Dark {rsthemes}\") # dark theme\n\n  # Whenever the R session restarts inside RStudio...\n  setHook(\"rstudio.sessionInit\", function(isNewSession) {\n    # Automatically choose the correct theme based on time of day\n    rsthemes::use_theme_auto(dark_start = \"18:00\", dark_end = \"6:00\")\n  }, action = \"append\")\n}\n\n\nGo Back to the Default\nSometimes when you’re teaching or demonstrating RStudio features, you’d like to have your IDE match the appearance of your learners, or at least the basic theme that everyone starts out with when they install RStudio for the first time.\nUse the Use Default RStudio Theme to quickly switch back to RStudio’s default theme, Textmate. Or, you can use rsthemes::use_default_rstudio_theme() to initiate the switch, perhaps from within the .Rprofile file of your teaching project."

    "text": "UPDATE 10/17/2017: Don’t use this! I made it for myself so it works for what I needed it for. But you probably shouldn’t use this package. There are better ways of building SQL queries that are safer and better (and probably even easier). For now, let me just point you in the direction of db.rstudio.com, dplyr/dbplyr, and the recently added glue_sql() function in the glue package.\nProject Links: source, documentation\nsqrrl is a small collection of utility functions that help build text-based SQL queries in an R-style native-feeling and functional manner.\nUnlike other packages that build SQL queries using an object-oriented style, sqrrl provides small functions that produce SQL snippets and can be linked together to compose SQL queries. The result is that the code to produce the SQL statement reads much like the SQL statement iteself. On the other hand, sqrrl doesn’t know anything about your database and can’t help you out with completions, etc.\nWhere this package is most useful is with Shiny web apps that interact with a MySQL backend. The utilities are all built so that queries can be built using column names and values stored inside ordinary R data structures.\nThe following is a quick demonstration of how the package works using the nyclights13 dataset. For more information on sqrrl, check out the package documentation."

    "text": "Queries are just strings\nNotice that unlike other packages, sqrrl can’t build the nested queries for you. You still need to understand the structure of the database and the structure of the query.\nBut when compared with the final output of the query, the sqrrl version looks a lot like SQL transliterated into R functions.\n\nSELECT() %+%\n  FROM(delay = parens(\n    SELECT('tailnum', delay = 'avg(arr_delay)', n = 'count(*)') %+%\n      FROM('flights') %+%\n      GROUP_BY('tailnum') %+%\n      ORDER_BY(DESC('delay'))\n  )) %+%\n  WHERE(gt(n = 100)) %+%\n  LIMIT(10) %&gt;%\n  sqlformat() %&gt;%\n  cat()\nSELECT *\n  FROM (\n        SELECT tailnum,\n               avg(arr_delay) AS delay,\n               count(*) AS n\n          FROM flights\n         GROUP BY tailnum\n         ORDER BY delay DESC\n       ) delay\n WHERE n&gt;100\n LIMIT 10\n\nFor me, at least, where the goal is to write SQL queries as bare strings, sqrrl lets me write in R and think in SQL without having to add a huge number of paste and paste0 functions.\nEverything in sqrrl takes input data from regular R data types and outputs an SQL snippet.\nFor an example of nearly everything each of the functions can do, see the Getting Started section in the documentation."

Authors blend prose and data, without having to copy and paste results. This is fantastic! But truly excellent reports require a lot of work in the final inch to get numerical and stylistic formatting just right.\n{epoxy} is a new package that uses {glue} to give authors templating super powers. First, authors can use epoxy chunks to write sentences or paragraphs in markdown with glue-like inline variables. Then, they can use inline formatting for common numerical or character transformations.\nEpoxy works in R Markdown and Quarto, in markdown, LaTeX and HTML outputs. It also provides easy templating for Shiny apps for dynamic data-driven reporting. Beyond epoxy’s features, this talk will also touch on tips and approaches for data-driven reporting that will be useful to a wide audience, from R Markdown experts to the Quarto and Shiny curious."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m in the process of responding to the second round of peer reviews of a paper I’ve spent considerable time working on over the past year. Of course, this time around I’ve learned a few new tricks that make the whole process easier to manage…\n\nI spent an entire weekend converting the paper from Word to LaTeX. By hand. But it’s now worth it.\nI coerced the other graduate student working on the paper to use Trello, so I can see what he’s working on now, what he’s planning to do next and what he’s already done.\nI’ve learned to use git in combination with BitBucket so individual changes are tracked and it’s easy to flip between old and current versions of the paper with a simple git checkout.\nI’ve learned how to use the powerful markdown language and document converter, pandoc, which I’m using to format our response to the reviewers.\n\nI’m following the format presented by Matt Might in Responding to peer review. It is an excellent guide to writing a response to peer reviewers, and the method he outlines fits perfectly into a pandoc workflow.\nFor example, the journal to which we are submitting is run by Elsevier, who certainly has a platform to coordinate communication between editors, authors, and reviewers. A platform that conveniently strips all formatting from the review text. But, after simply copying and pasting the review text into a text file, I add $ marks around the inline LaTeX and convert to PDF. Just reading the reviews is easier when the math and format is clear.\nConverting to PDF is as simple as:\npandoc response.txt -o response.pdf\nThen, following Matt Might’s workflow, I indent each reviewer response with a &gt; and prepare our replies underneath each item.\nWe were fortunate in that one reviewer offered a list of polite, meticulously detailed points. However, when converting our responses to PDF, the only difference between regular text and the LaTeX quote environment is increased indentation. When most of a document is normal text with only a few quotes, this is reasonable. But in our case it is very difficult to see, by indentation alone, exactly which text is the reviewer’s comment and which text is our rebuttal.\nAfter far too many hours digging through LaTeX and pandoc discussion forums and a long process of trial and error, I finally came up with the right commands to alter the quote environment. Simply include these lines at the beginning of your markdown file, and pandoc will apply the LaTeX code when converting to pdf.\n\\let\\quoteOld\\quote\n\\let\\endquoteOld\\endquote\n\\renewenvironment{quote}{\\quoteOld\\itshape}{\\endquoteOld}\nYou can save the above lines in a file called preamble.tex that you can then include in the LaTeX header with the pandoc --include-in-header argument.\npandoc --include-in-header preamble.tex response.txt -o response.pdf\nRather than remember to include this code every time you want italicized block quotes, you can download the pandoc default.latex template file, rename it something memorable – like italicquotes.tex – and add the above code somewhere near the top. (Somewhere after the first string of \\usepackage commands is probably best.)\nThen, copy the italicquotes.tex to the pandoc templates folder, which I found in the following folder:\ncp italicquotes.tex /usr/local/share/pandoc-1.11.1/data/templates/\nTo use this template, simply add --template=italicquotes.tex when you call pandoc:\npandoc -N --template=italicquotes.tex response.txt -o response.pdf\nOr, with fancy fonts:\npandoc -N --template=italicquotes.tex \\\n          --variable mainfont=Georgia \\\n          --variable sansfont=Arial \\\n          --variable fontsize=12pt \\\n          response.txt --latex-engine=xelatex -o response.pdf"

He advised young students to learn programming skills and to embrace what is traditionally thought of as “computer science”. They are important skills too often left out of IE curricula but that are highly valuable and relevant to the work of IEs in the field.\nIt was a heartening statement to hear, given that our INFORMS student chapter has organized a two-day intense introduction to programming “boot camp” we’ll be running next week called the…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In working with the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 data set, it can often be very difficult to assess the condition of a given patient, or the trends within those the time series variables provided.\nThere is a lot of variability between the number of variables recorded (and the number of observations per variable) for each patient. As a medical data set, the data is characterized by highly non-linear trends, and it can be difficult to get a handle on it in a table format. Worse, the training set is nearly 2 million rows long when training patient data is joined together — a result of presenting patient data in three rows: Time, Parameter, Value.\nFurthermore, there is a large variation in the reliability of the data recorded in each variable. A machine-read variable may be more reliable than a variable whose observations are recorded by hand by a human.\nThus, in exploring the data set, it may be useful at times to visually see the input data validate model output or to explore unusual cases or values. R provides a straight-forward language with good packages for pretty graphs, making it a good choice for this type of visualization.\n\nA nice looking plot\nThis post will help you learn to run R code that produce graphs like this. (Note: learn to run, not learn to write… that’s a much longer post and maybe I’ll get to it later.)\n\nThe image shows all of the time-series variables available for patients in Set A, ordered alphabetically, with a fixed time scale in minutes after arrival in the ICU. Descriptive variables, including some calculated variables, are printed at the top of the plot.\nThe plot is generated by sending a list of RecordID’s to a function, plotByID(), which will either display the plot on the screen, or save it to the working directory.\n\n\nGetting Started\nFirst, download and install RStudio. This should be relatively painless. You’ll also need the code and the data set. The original data set is from the PhysioNet 2012 Computing in Cardiology. I’ve simply pulled each individual patient file into one dataset and added a new column for RecordID.\nExtract plotByID.zip somewhere where you’ll find it and fire up RStudio. You should see a screen that looks a lot like this:\n\nYou’ve got the Console on the left, Workspace and Files on the right. This code uses Hadley Wickham’s excellent plotting package ggplot2, which isn’t installed by default. To install it, click on Install packages under the Tools menu, type ggplot2 in the text box and hit enter. Everything should install fine.\nTo load the code, click on the … in the Files pane and open the folder where you extracted the data set. To make sure everything runs within this directory, click “Set working directory” under the More button. Open plotByID.R. Now you should see this:\n\nThe code to load and plot the data is now open in the upper left window. Take a look at it and read through it if you want. To load it up, simply select everything (Ctrl/⌘+A) and then click Run or hit Ctrl/⌘+Enter. The data set and necessary functions will load, and the demo plot above will appear, like magic.\n\n\nUsing plotByID()\nThe plotting function is pretty self-explanatory. It takes a primary argument of a RecordID or a vector of RecordIDs and returns a plot. There are also arguments to save the plot to a particular path and to control whether or not the plot displays on the screen.\nTo plot input patient data to the screen you only have to enter one RecordID, by simply typing\nplotByID(133966)\nin the console and hitting enter. To plot multiple patients, use a vector, which in R is denoted by the command c(). Thus,\nplotByID( c(133966, 140334) )\nwill plot the input data for two patients. To plot a random sample of 10 patients use the sample() function:\nplotByID( sample(seta$RecordID, 10 )\nIf you want the images to save to the working directory, use\nplotByID(133966, save=TRUE, path=path)\nYou don’t have to manually specify the path variable, it’s been set to the working directory. If you want to change the saving path, set\npath=\"~/Your/Directory/Here\"\nThat’s it. I hope this makes it a little easier to see what you’re working with! ;)"

    "text": "Why xaringan?\nEffective communication is the keystone of impactful data science. Whether teaching data-related skills or reporting the latest modelling results, by and large R users are expected to communicate highly complex topics to students and stakeholders. Furthermore, our computational data work requires that our presentations and reports are both reproducible when we need to recreate today’s work in the future, as well as adaptable when tomorrow’s data changes today’s results. And, not least of all, effective communication demands that our medium of communication is accessible to all, regardless of socio-economic status, activity limitations or disability.\nCreating presentations with the xaringan package embodies all of these requisite skills: built on the literate programming markdown syntax familiar to users of R Markdown, it produces reproducible HTML slides that enable effective, accessible communication across sectors, disciplines, and experiences.\nAlong the way, working with xaringan fosters a level of web literacy that is immensely useful in many other venues of online communication such as with web-based documents and apps created using R Markdown and Shiny."

I’ve also heard that if you send the same email more than once, turn that email into a blog post.\nBut all the real work in life happens on Slack. So if a friend asks for your advice and you brain dump everything you know about the easiest way to install and manage Python, then you’ve got a first draft blog post on your hands!\nThey also say the hardest part of writing is staring at the blank page. But they are wrong. The hardest part of writing is figuring out how to start a new .qmd file in your blog repo without bumping into 3 to 10 other things you have been meaning to do.\nOr worse, you might encounter that draft post you’ve been working on for months. Learn from my mistakes: it’s okay to stash that post, you can always tell yourself you’ll come back to it later!\nYou can probably tell by now that this is not a post about Python tooling for a happy setup. It’s also not a post about the few CSS tweaks I made while trying to open up this editor.\nThis post is sponsored by this a bit of YAML that caught my eye in my _quarto.yml file in the split second before I closed all my open tabs.\npage-footer:\n    left: &gt;-\n      © 2023 Garrick Aden-Buie\nThis is not acceptable. It has been 2024 for a whole 89 days and that little © 2023 has been sitting in my page footer the entire time. I’m lucky I haven’t gotten any angry emails about it!\nNow the fix could be easy. Consider this: I could change that file, commit it, and push it.\npage-footer:\n  left: &gt;-\n-    © 2023 Garrick Aden-Buie\n+    © 2024 Garrick Aden-Buie\nOne GitHub Action, several minutes, and two Netlify notifications later my blog would be back to the future.\nBut this obviously won’t work. Time stops for no one. What will I do in March of 2025? Come back to this file and edit it by hand? Again? Like a caveman? Hard no.\nWouldn’t it be awesome if I could replace that 2023 that should be 2024 with something that turns into the current year whenever my blog rebuilds? I could save minutes in the entire lifetime of my blog! Imagine replacing the 2023 with something that would update itself automatically, like this:\npage-footer:\n  left: &gt;-\n    © {{&lt; now year &gt;}} Garrick Aden-Buie\nIt would be awesome, but that syntax doesn’t exist in Quarto. Or it didn’t until I my productive procrastination instincts kicked in!\nIntroducing now, a quarto extension for easily adding the time right now – err… the time right now when your Quarto blog or document is rendered."

Both work in the same way, except that {{&lt; modified &gt;}} will show the last modified time of the document, either by using the modified metadata field or the last modified timestamp of the file (on macOS and Linux only, sorry).\nHere’s a quick example of the shortcodes in use. Note that in this post I added the modified date, which gives me a bit more control over what counts as a “modification”.\n---\ntitle: Add last rendered or modified time to Quarto\nmodified: 2024-03-29\n---\n\nThis document was last modified at {{&lt; modified &gt;}}\nand it was last rendered at {{&lt; now &gt;}}.\n\nThis document was last modified at 2024-03-29 00:00:00 and it was last rendered at 2024-03-29 10:13:58."

Note that because the format string has a space, it needs to be quoted \"%B %Y\".\nYou can find the complete list of accepted format strings in the now extension docs."
