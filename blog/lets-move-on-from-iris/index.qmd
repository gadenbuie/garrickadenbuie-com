It only takes two lines to get started.
First, check the source code on <https://git.io/de-iris-my-repos>.
Then run these two lines in your R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("https://git.io/de-iris-my-repos")
iris_issues <- de_iris_my_repos()
```

Last week,
motivated by the Black Lives Matter movement and protests around the United States,
[Daniela Witten][dw]
wrote a long and insightful
[Twitter thread][fisher-thread]
about the origins of an often-used and completely boring dataset: `iris`.

`r blogdown::shortcode("twitter", "1268392721275744256")`

I've long known about Ronald Fisher's eugenicist past,
but I admit that I have often thoughtlessly turned to `iris`
when needing a small, boring data set to demonstrate a coding or data principle.

But Daniella and Timothée Poisot are right:
[it's time to retire _iris_][retire-iris].

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Like many people, I have spent the last 10 days watching so much tragedy unfold. So much anguish from Black colleagues here on twitter. <br><br>And so I've been trying to think of ways that *I* can improve my tiny corner of the world.  <br><br>A thread on why change is hard in academia  1/</p>— Dr. Daniela Witten (&commat;daniela_witten) <a href="https://twitter.com/daniela_witten/status/1268392721275744256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

## Other Options

I read Daniella's thread and Timothée's blog post and
immediately realized that I needed to be more thoughtful in my choice of datasets.
There is absolutely no need for `iris` in my examples;
there are plenty of other options available.

I'm particularly excited about a new [penguins dataset][penguins]
announced on Twitter by the amazing Allison Horst.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Iris dataset feels really gross now.</p>— Chris Albon (&commat;chrisalbon) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon/status/1268594959436804097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

Here's a short list of other data sets you can turn to instead:

- Anything else in `data()`.

- `ggplot2::mpg`

- `ggplot2::diamonds`

- `dplyr::starwars`

- <span class="pkg">nycflights13</span>

- <span class="pkg">fivethirtyeight</span>

- Any of the many [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) datasets

## De-Iris Your Repos

To help us move on into an `iris`-free world,
I've created a small command-line utility to [de_iris_my_repos()][gh].

The code is available on GitHub at [gadenbuie/de-iris-my-repos][gh],
and it only takes two lines in your console to find any references to `iris`
in your repositories and open an issue in each repo reminding you to kick `iris` out.

_`de_iris_my_repos()` won't do anything without your explicit consent, but you should still probably check the R script before your source it._

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("https://git.io/de-iris-my-repos")
iris_issues <- de_iris_my_repos()
```

When you run `de_iris_my_repos()` it searches your public code for mentions of `iris`
and asks you if you want to open an issue in each repo.
If you do,
it opens an issue using the template in the screen shot below
so that you can remember to remove `iris`.

### Options

A few options are available in `de_iris_my_repos()`

- Choose which GitHub `user` name to review, by default the user associated with the GitHub PAT used by [gh](https://github.com/r-lib/gh)

- Set `dry_run = TRUE` to return results without doing anything

- Set `ask = FALSE` to go ahead and open issues in all repositories

- Use `extensions` to provide a list of file types where `iris` might be found.
