GitHub user [\@stanstrup][stanstrup-gh] posted [a question][blogdown-issue] today on the [blogdown GitHub repo][blogdown-gh] about manually positioning a table of contents in blogdown:

> When I use `toc: true` in a post the toc is inserted at the very top of the post.
> ... If you could specify the position of the toc with some keyword you could work around it.

I don't use the [academic theme for Hugo][hugo-academic] (I use a modified version of [hyde][my-theme]), so I'm not entirely sure if I can completely solve stanstrup's problems, but I know I've run into something similar recently.

And while Yihui is probably right that [the effort isn't worth it](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/267#issuecomment-369272039) when fiddling with trivial aesthetics, I use R Markdown in enough places and have run into this a few times.
Knowing that someone else out there felt the same pain was enough to push me to code up a quick solution.

The function I've worked up is called `render_toc()` and it allows you to drop in a table of contents anywhere inside an R Markdown document.
This means you can use it to manually position a table of contents in:

- A README file for your package repo
- In a long blogdown post
- In an overview slide in xaringan

and many more places.

## Get It

I've posted [the function and an example document as a GitHub Gist][render-toc-gist].
To use it in your document, choose one of the following:

1. Download `render_toc.R` and `source("render_toc.R")` in your project or script

2. Copy the function code into your RMarkdown document

3. Source the function from GitHub using `devtools`:

    ```r
    devtools::source_gist("c83e078bf8c81b035e32c3fc0cf04ee8",
                          filename = 'render_toc.R')
    ```

## Use It

I included an example file in the [GitHub Gist][render-toc-gist].
Essentially, you just need to source `render_toc.R` somewhere (such as a setup chunk) and then call it in the document where you want to render the table of contents.

The output will just be a markdown list, so if you want to give the table of contents it's own header, you'll have to include that in the document.

Here's what a simple R Markdown document would look like.

````
```{r setup, include=FALSE} `r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
devtools::source_gist("c83e078bf8c81b035e32c3fc0cf04ee8",
                      filename = 'render_toc.R')
```

## Table of Contents

```{r toc, echo=FALSE} `r ''`
render_toc("blogdown-toc-example.Rmd")
```

# Writing

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document...

```{r cars} `r ''`
# This is not a header
summary(cars)
```

## Regular Code

```r
# Regular markdown code (not run)
plot(pressure)
```

# Plots

## Including Plots {#plots-are-here .class-foo}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} `r ''`
plot(pressure)
```
````

which outputs as
<a href="2018-02-28-blogdown-toc-example.png" class="lightbox">this document (click to view image)</a>.

## Behind the Scenes

The function simply reads through the lines of the RMarkdown document and strips out any code blocks.
The supported code fencing style is three or more &grave; characters in a row.

Then I extract the headers, which must be in the hashtag-style to work.
In other words headers like this

```
## A Nice Header
```

work well, while headers like these won't be processed

```
A Not So Nice Header
====================
```

The function creates the header anchor if not manually specified -- see the [pandoc header identifiers](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#header-identifiers) help page for more information -- or uses the identifier if it is included.

The example above would link to `#a-nice-header` and the example below links to `#my-shortcut`

```
## An Overly Wordy Header Title {#my-shortcut}
```

Any headers with a higher depth than the `toc_depth` parameter (default is `3`) are discarded.
Also any initial headers prior to the first base level header with higher levels (say `###` when the base level is `##`) are discarded as well.

Finally, if `toc_header_name` is set, the header with that name is discarded so that the TOC itself isn't included in the TOC.

The end result is a simple markdown list that can be rendered anywhere!

```{r echo=TRUE}
devtools::source_gist("c83e078bf8c81b035e32c3fc0cf04ee8",
                      filename = 'render_toc.R')

# `this_post` is set in the setup chunk,
# points to the Rmd file for this post
render_toc(this_post)
```

Which, underneath, is just markdown.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='markup', comment=''}
cat(render_toc(this_post))
```
