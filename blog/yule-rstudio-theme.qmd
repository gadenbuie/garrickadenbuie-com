## &#x1F385; &#x1F936; 'Tis the season to be jolly!

Bring yuletide cheer and seasons greetings to your [favorite R IDE](https://rstudio.com). Based on the [Yule tmTheme][yule-base] and modified to fit in well with RStudio Dark Mode. It's surprisingly pleasant and merrily festive!

## Installation

You'll need RStudio version 1.2. Grab the [preview version here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).

1. Run the following code in RStudio to download and apply the theme.

   ```r
   yule_theme <- fs::path_temp("Yule-RStudio", ext = "rstheme")
   download.file("https://git.io/yule-rstudio", yule_theme)
   rstudioapi::addTheme(yule_theme, apply = TRUE)
   ```

1. &#x2615; Make a cup of hot coco,

    &#x1F4FB; turn on [SomaFM's Christmas Lounge](https://somafm.com/christmas/),

    &#x1F4BB; and enjoy coding by the open fire.

#### Manual Installation

If the steps above don't work, you can manually download the [Yule-RStudio.rstheme](https://github.com/gadenbuie/yule-rstudio/blob/master/Yule-RStudio.rstheme) file and place it in `.R/rstudio/themes` in your R home directory (see `path.expand("~")`). Then, in the RStudio appearance settings, select the _Yule RStudio_ editor theme.

## How I Made This

I made this the way I do all web development: right-click on the thing I want to change, choose **Inspect Element**, and hack at it until it looks reasonable.
Somehow this even works in RStudio!
(It's a web app underneath.)

As a starting point, though, I used found the [Yule theme][yule-base] on the [tmTheme Editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com) and fiddled with the base colors there until they worked well with RStudio's blueish dark theme.

The upcoming 1.2 version of RStudio now
[supports adding themes](https://github.com/batpigandme/night-owlish/blob/master/installation_notes.md),
and `.tmTheme` files are converted automatically into RStudio's `.rstheme` format.
Turns out, an `.rstheme` is just CSS!

This got me half the way there, but there were still a number of missing elements that I wanted to tweak.
Figuring out how tmTheme scopes get mapped to [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) CSS classes was painful trial and error.
To get the theme all the way there, I went straight to the source.
I opened up a few scripts and R Markdown documents, used **Insepect Element** to identify the appropriate Ace CSS class, and then fiddled until it looked ~~great~~ good enough.

The blinking Christmas-light cursor is just a CSS animation!

```css
.normal-mode .ace_cursor {
  border: 0!important;
  animation-name: color;
  animation-duration: 10s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: step-start;
  opacity: 0.75;
}

@keyframes color {
  0% {
    background-color: #ff00a9;
  }
  20% {
    background-color: #7c3eff;
  }
  40% {
    background-color: #64f3f0;
  }
  60% {
    background-color: #4fe818;
  }
  80% {
    background-color: #ffc400;
  }
  100 {
    background-color: #ff0010;
  }
}
```

### &#x26A0;&#xFE0F; May waste some CPU cycles in the spirit of the holidays!

The animated christmas-light cursors may increase the CPU usage of RStudio.
To disable the animations but still enjoy the theme, edit the theme file in `~/.R/rstudio/themes/Yule-RStudio.rstheme`.

```r
rstudioapi::navigateToFile(
  fs::path_home_r(".R", "rstudio", "themes", "Yule-RStudio.rstheme")
)
```

Find the CSS blocks for `.ace_cursor` and `.normal-mode .ace_cursor` and comment out the lines starting with `animation-*`.

```css
.ace_cursor {
  color: #ff0010;
  /*
  animation-name: xmas-colors;
  animation-duration: 30s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: steps;
  */
}
```
