Faced with a growing elderly population, learning and characterizing  activity
profiles of smart home occupants will support senior health care management
for older adults living in homes augmented by ambient intelligence solutions
that combine ubiquitous computing and artificial intelligence. In this work,
we explore a bag of n-grams approach for creating occupant-specific activity
profiles from event streams collected from passive, embedded sensors in
real-world sensor networks in the homes of several older adults.
